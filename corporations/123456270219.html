                            With an extensive network of partners in over 60 countries, SYSPROs strength is in its depth. SYSPRO resellers and partners not only provide consulting, sales and product implementation, they also bring insights about customers business challenges back to SYSPRO, fuelling future product enhancements.<br>
SYSPRO invests deeply in its reseller network, forging long-term and mutually beneficial relationships with its partners.<br>
SYSPRO stands behind its channel and offers customers a variety of services to supplement consulting and support. SYSPRO engages directly with customers when the size and scope of a project exceeds a channel partners capacity, or when multiple channel partners need to be coordinated.<br>

              Abbotsford Concrete is a multi-site supplier of concrete products. The company needed better visibility<br>

Arctic Manufacturing- Arctic Manufacturing is a private company situated in Prince George, British Columbia. Like most companies in the global marketplace, Arctic relies on efficient business processes to maintain its competitive edge in difficult times. Having an appropriate enterprise resource planning (ERP) system has helped integrate its key operations, and synchronize, plan and optimize its available resources. Using SYSPRO offers a wealth of real-time information that has greatly enhanced the insight of company decision makers.<br>
<br>
Atlantic Tube and Steel- Implementing SYSPRO has enabled AT&amp;S to fully automate its production floors. That allows us to look at the shop floor in terms of reducing man-hours. In addition, with SYSPRO we no longer need our manual production reporting process. In the past, while a mill operator was supposed to be watching the seam, or adjusting the heat source, he would sometimes have his back to the mill while he prepared his reports. These days, the whole production process, from input to output, is all recorded and reported by SYSPRO. Not only does that eliminate a ton of paperwork, it provides us with the ability to get information more efficiently, so we can analyze the data on a timely basis. <br>
<br>
BioVectra- Existing accounting package no longer met the expanding companys needs, Increasing regulations required tight control of inventory, production, inventory, quality control and data. Enabled better decisions based on more widely available information.<br>
<br>
WeighPack Systems- SYSPRO provides an integrated manufacturing and distribution solution, as well as real-time inventory and financial information, across multiple warehouses and corporate entities.<br>
<br>
Natural Factors Nutritional Products- As a manufacturer of naturally-sourced nutraceuticals and supplements, Natural Factors places enormous emphasis on quality control. Natural Factors began automating its systems in 1992 and needed total supply chain management and financial tracking capabilities.<br>
<br>
Circa Enterprises- Circa Enterprises Inc. is a multi-site manufacturer of surge protection devices for the telecommunications industry. The manufacturing is 50% make to order and 50% engineer to order. Circa needed comprehensive manufacturing planning and control to see where the organization stood from an<br>
operational perspective and to make informed decisions about improvements for key manufacturing indicators.<br>
<br>
Seon Design- To improve product assembly, supply chain management and post-sales tracking to meet<br>
evolving needs during a time of rapid product class expansion.

              ARCTIC MANUFACTURING <br>

<br>
DANIELS ELECTRONICS<br>
We have considered much more expensive ERP products, but they didnt offer more than what we already have and SYSPRO has provided solutions to meet all our needs. As well, weve always had excellent support from SYSPRO.<br>

              Abbotsford Concrete is a multi-site supplier of concrete products. The company needed better visibility<br>

Arctic Manufacturing- Arctic Manufacturing is a private company situated in Prince George, British Columbia. Like most companies in the global marketplace, Arctic relies on efficient business processes to maintain its competitive edge in difficult times. Having an appropriate enterprise resource planning (ERP) system has helped integrate its key operations, and synchronize, plan and optimize its available resources. Using SYSPRO offers a wealth of real-time information that has greatly enhanced the insight of company decision makers.<br>
<br>
Atlantic Tube and Steel- Implementing SYSPRO has enabled AT&amp;S to fully automate its production floors. That allows us to look at the shop floor in terms of reducing man-hours. In addition, with SYSPRO we no longer need our manual production reporting process. In the past, while a mill operator was supposed to be watching the seam, or adjusting the heat source, he would sometimes have his back to the mill while he prepared his reports. These days, the whole production process, from input to output, is all recorded and reported by SYSPRO. Not only does that eliminate a ton of paperwork, it provides us with the ability to get information more efficiently, so we can analyze the data on a timely basis. <br>
<br>
BioVectra- Existing accounting package no longer met the expanding companys needs, Increasing regulations required tight control of inventory, production, inventory, quality control and data. Enabled better decisions based on more widely available information.<br>
<br>
WeighPack Systems- SYSPRO provides an integrated manufacturing and distribution solution, as well as real-time inventory and financial information, across multiple warehouses and corporate entities.<br>
<br>
Natural Factors Nutritional Products- As a manufacturer of naturally-sourced nutraceuticals and supplements, Natural Factors places enormous emphasis on quality control. Natural Factors began automating its systems in 1992 and needed total supply chain management and financial tracking capabilities.<br>
<br>
Circa Enterprises- Circa Enterprises Inc. is a multi-site manufacturer of surge protection devices for the telecommunications industry. The manufacturing is 50% make to order and 50% engineer to order. Circa needed comprehensive manufacturing planning and control to see where the organization stood from an<br>
operational perspective and to make informed decisions about improvements for key manufacturing indicators.<br>
<br>
Seon Design- To improve product assembly, supply chain management and post-sales tracking to meet<br>
evolving needs during a time of rapid product class expansion.

              ARCTIC MANUFACTURING <br>
One of the most important consequences of using SYSPRO, is that our inventory control has tightened considerably, without having to add additional people or increase anybody&#39;s workload.<br>
Blair Stunder, General Manager, Arctic Manufacturing<br>

Susan Gater, Operations Manager, Cedarlane Laboratories<br>
<br>
DANIELS ELECTRONICS<br>
We have considered much more expensive ERP products, but they didnt offer more than what we already have and SYSPRO has provided solutions to meet all our needs. As well, weve always had excellent support from SYSPRO.<br>
