                            This is the best choral folder available for singers and directors. We&#39;ve been improving it year after year and we&#39;re reaching the limit of improvement possible for its mulipurpose design intent.<br>
<br>
Detailed description:<br>
<br>
The Black Folder (deluxe) is a durable, lightweight, ergonomic folder with options available to suit everyone&#39;s requirements. <br>
<br>
The deluxe version is able to open flat; the bottom cross-strap can be un-buttoned on one side.<br>
<br>
One of the more important features that differ our folders from other folders is the bottom strap, which is attached at the outside base of the folder. This gives three benefits: more room inside; page turns that don&#39;t scrape against the strap; and lastly, a bookmark: that bottom strap angles in at 45 degrees when closing the folder, to act as a bookmark for impromptu bows during concerts - with no panic at the next upbeat - because you&#39;re on the right page when the folder opens again.<br>
<br>
The folder has a comfortable hand strap at back for you to hold it securely, and the deeply-textured leatherette aids in dissipating perspiration from your hand if you are performing under hot stage lights. A lightweight aluminum hinge is riveted securely inside, to give the folder superior rigidity and durability, and all folders come with a minimum of 10 lengths of elasticized cord. You can slide your music behind the cords to hold it in concert order, impossible to drop, and faster to find during rehearsal. Extra cords and ring adaptors for hole-punched paper are also available.<br>
<br>
Expandable pockets store surplus music. All folders include a name card pocket and name card, and hold US Letter and A4 and all common score sizes with ease. Larger works or hymnals can rest in the folder, sure not to slip out because of the bottom strap, or you can put multiple cords in different places in the music to flip to that point or to skip sections quickly.<br>
<br>
Finally, a popular option is a clear pocket that overlays the existing left pocket. You can read your concert program or church service bulletin through the transparent pocket, instead of having to pull it up to see the lower portion of the page. It&#39;s also handy for notes such as changes in standing order and rehearsal plans for directors. Photos, especially from choirs that tour, tend to end up in that clear pocket too.<br>

                            We are very pleased to introduce this new design! It is uniquely a singer&#39;s folder (in contrast to our deluxe versions of The Black Folder, designed for both singers and conductors). Your continued support of the best folders we can make, year after year, has allowed us to invest in this unique design, giving you a new choice that we believe will be very much appreciated by singers around the world.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve shaved 10% off the weight of the nearest comparable &quot;Black Folder&quot; version, and trimmed the size and concert configuration width down just a bit so you&#39;re not so crowded when you&#39;re performing with too many people packed on too few risers. The back panel is one-piece construction as opposed to 3 panels stitched together. The spine is thicker and more durable, more rounded and comfortable, and with special deep grooves that allow the material to flex around the hinge. Those grooves also help to dissipate perspiration from your hand if you&#39;re performing under hot stage lights. <br>
<br>
We&#39;ve put a second pencil holder on the left side, and included one of our most popular options, the clear pocket for programs, in the base model. All this comes at a price under the cost of the deluxe Black Folder. The Choralex Compact still holds A4 and US letter and common score sizes easily and has room for a ring adaptor (CC-A version) or double cords (CC-C) as well. In fact, the capacity inside is wider, so we&#39;re now including a 1-inch (2.5 cm) diameter 3-ring adaptor when the ring version is chosen.<br>

                            This is the best choral folder for singers, directors, and accompanists who need a folder holding hole-punched music. In addition to having a comfortable hand-strap, it can nicely open flat to be placed on a piano, organ, or podium. <br>
<br>
Detailed description:<br>
<br>
The MUSICFOLDER.com RingBinder is the newest addition to our line of folders, launched in the Spring of 2008 in response to customer demand. It&#39;s like a ring binder on steroids, and is &#39;the&#39; answer for those who primarily want to use rings to hold music that has been hole-punched. Magazine holders fitting into the rings can be used, allowing larger scores, or music not to be hole-punched, to be held in the folder also.<br>
<br>
It is a durable, lightweight, ergonomic folder with the most popular features of our other folders, at best price, and optimized for holding hole-punched music. This version has a bottom strap which can be un-buttoned on one side to open the folder flat.<br>
<br>
A solidly-mounted 1&quot; set of rings opens with the push of a single button, and they feature a snag-free interlock to avoid catching paper mid-turn, for quiet page turns of recording-studio quality. One of the more important features that differ our folders from other folders is the bottom strap, which is attached at the outside base of the folder. This gives three benefits: more room inside; page turns that don&#39;t scrape against the strap; and lastly, a bookmark: that bottom strap angles in at 45 degrees when closing the folder, to act as a bookmark for impromptu bows during concerts - with no panic at the next upbeat - because you&#39;re on the right page when the folder opens again.<br>
<br>
The folder has a comfortable hand strap at back for you to hold it securely, and the deeply-textured leatherette aids in dissipating perspiration from your hand if you are performing under hot stage lights. <br>
<br>
A side-expanding pocket at right can store surplus music. All folders include a name card pocket and name card, and hold US Letter and A4 and all common score sizes with ease. Having only one booster tab at the bottom means that taller European A4 music punched in North American 3-hole style will not bump a ring booster tab at the top.<br>
<br>
Finally, a clear pocket is included at left; you can read your concert program or church service bulletin through the transparent pocket, instead of having to pull it up to see the lower portion of the page. It&#39;s also handy for notes such as changes in standing order and rehearsal plans for directors. Photos, especially from choirs that tour, tend to end up in that clear pocket too. <br>
<br>
Other countries don&#39;t necessarily use 3-ring adaptors; so below you can choose MUSICFOLDER.com RingBinder folders with 2-ring or 4-ring adaptors which are 19 mm in diameter. These are initially available in limited quantity.<br>

                            The PocketTones Pitch Pipe is the perfect pitch accessory to add to your keychain to give accurate pitch for practice or concerts.<br>
<br>
It has a volume control to allow a discreet pitch for only you to hear, or a good loud tone that will carry for a larger choir. You don&#39;t have to suck the lint out before blowing into an acoustic pitch pipe or wonder whether the last person to borrow it was in good health!<br>
<br>
It&#39;s handy, durable, compact, and this inexpensive 12-note version is ideal for voice or instruments. You can give notes of a chord in quick succession as well. Batteries included (AG-13).<br>
<br>
Directions: <br>
1. Press desired note button to turn pitch ON.<br>
2. Press same note button again to turn OFF.<br>
3. Adjust volume as needed by rotating knob on side of unit<br>
4. Auto shut-off feature after 15 seconds.<br>

                            This clip-on (or free-standing) light has a bright super-L.E.D. bulb that never needs replacing and gives up to 50 hours per set of 3 AAA batteries, which are included.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s incredibly light; casts an even beam, has an adjustable stem to position it exactly where you want. The padded clip holds securely to a thin folder or a thick piano stand with equal ease.<br>
<br>
For touring to venues where you&#39;re unsure of lighting conditions, or the savings in time and shipping of setting up bulky extension cords and light sets, having one of these lights in your Gig Bag is always a bright idea. <br>
<br>
NEW! Just added: XtraFlex DUET has 2 heads for wider light dispersion especially for conductors who have their music flat and thus opened wider. Batteries not included in the DUET, but it has a lifetime of up to 20 hours with 3 AAA batteries. Any choir that ever performs away from its usual location should keep one or two of these handy for the director or accompanist at minimum, for poorly lit venues, or that afternoon dress rehearsal on tour that you find is just not so bright in the evening concert.<br>

Imprinting typically adds up to 5 business days to your order; from mid-August to November allow up to 10 business days. <br>
 <br>
<br>
The normal colour for imprinting is gold, to match the black-and-gold/brass colour styling of the folders.<br>
<br>
However, most other colours are available by request, on regular text imprinting and logo imprinting.<br>

              The Black Folder has utility beyond the use by <br>
choirs for which it was designed.  <br>
Pharmaceutical <br>
companies use it as an elegant binder for their <br>
sales force to hold new product descriptions, <br>
and <br>
teachers or presenters can also securely and <br>
comfortably hold materials in one hand, leaving <br>
the other free to write, point, and give more <br>
effective presentations.

              Top choirs across the world have heard of or use The Black Folder. Distributors from Carus-Verlag in Germany to Pana Musica in Japan allow musicians the greater ease of obtaining our product locally.

              Sales have increased by and average of over 25% <br>
each year in the past 4 years.  Design <br>
improvements and quality service have made this <br>
product so popular that we have cut back on <br>
advertising as we develop on-line solutions and <br>
manage growth to retain the same level of <br>
service.

                            This is the best choral folder available for singers and directors. We&#39;ve been improving it year after year and we&#39;re reaching the limit of improvement possible for its mulipurpose design intent.<br>
<br>
Detailed description:<br>
<br>
The Black Folder (deluxe) is a durable, lightweight, ergonomic folder with options available to suit everyone&#39;s requirements. <br>
<br>
The deluxe version is able to open flat; the bottom cross-strap can be un-buttoned on one side.<br>
<br>
One of the more important features that differ our folders from other folders is the bottom strap, which is attached at the outside base of the folder. This gives three benefits: more room inside; page turns that don&#39;t scrape against the strap; and lastly, a bookmark: that bottom strap angles in at 45 degrees when closing the folder, to act as a bookmark for impromptu bows during concerts - with no panic at the next upbeat - because you&#39;re on the right page when the folder opens again.<br>
<br>
The folder has a comfortable hand strap at back for you to hold it securely, and the deeply-textured leatherette aids in dissipating perspiration from your hand if you are performing under hot stage lights. A lightweight aluminum hinge is riveted securely inside, to give the folder superior rigidity and durability, and all folders come with a minimum of 10 lengths of elasticized cord. You can slide your music behind the cords to hold it in concert order, impossible to drop, and faster to find during rehearsal. Extra cords and ring adaptors for hole-punched paper are also available.<br>
<br>
Expandable pockets store surplus music. All folders include a name card pocket and name card, and hold US Letter and A4 and all common score sizes with ease. Larger works or hymnals can rest in the folder, sure not to slip out because of the bottom strap, or you can put multiple cords in different places in the music to flip to that point or to skip sections quickly.<br>
<br>
Finally, a popular option is a clear pocket that overlays the existing left pocket. You can read your concert program or church service bulletin through the transparent pocket, instead of having to pull it up to see the lower portion of the page. It&#39;s also handy for notes such as changes in standing order and rehearsal plans for directors. Photos, especially from choirs that tour, tend to end up in that clear pocket too.<br>

                            We are very pleased to introduce this new design! It is uniquely a singer&#39;s folder (in contrast to our deluxe versions of The Black Folder, designed for both singers and conductors). Your continued support of the best folders we can make, year after year, has allowed us to invest in this unique design, giving you a new choice that we believe will be very much appreciated by singers around the world.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve shaved 10% off the weight of the nearest comparable &quot;Black Folder&quot; version, and trimmed the size and concert configuration width down just a bit so you&#39;re not so crowded when you&#39;re performing with too many people packed on too few risers. The back panel is one-piece construction as opposed to 3 panels stitched together. The spine is thicker and more durable, more rounded and comfortable, and with special deep grooves that allow the material to flex around the hinge. Those grooves also help to dissipate perspiration from your hand if you&#39;re performing under hot stage lights. <br>
<br>
We&#39;ve put a second pencil holder on the left side, and included one of our most popular options, the clear pocket for programs, in the base model. All this comes at a price under the cost of the deluxe Black Folder. The Choralex Compact still holds A4 and US letter and common score sizes easily and has room for a ring adaptor (CC-A version) or double cords (CC-C) as well. In fact, the capacity inside is wider, so we&#39;re now including a 1-inch (2.5 cm) diameter 3-ring adaptor when the ring version is chosen.<br>

                            This is the best choral folder for singers, directors, and accompanists who need a folder holding hole-punched music. In addition to having a comfortable hand-strap, it can nicely open flat to be placed on a piano, organ, or podium. <br>
<br>
Detailed description:<br>
<br>
The MUSICFOLDER.com RingBinder is the newest addition to our line of folders, launched in the Spring of 2008 in response to customer demand. It&#39;s like a ring binder on steroids, and is &#39;the&#39; answer for those who primarily want to use rings to hold music that has been hole-punched. Magazine holders fitting into the rings can be used, allowing larger scores, or music not to be hole-punched, to be held in the folder also.<br>
<br>
It is a durable, lightweight, ergonomic folder with the most popular features of our other folders, at best price, and optimized for holding hole-punched music. This version has a bottom strap which can be un-buttoned on one side to open the folder flat.<br>
<br>
A solidly-mounted 1&quot; set of rings opens with the push of a single button, and they feature a snag-free interlock to avoid catching paper mid-turn, for quiet page turns of recording-studio quality. One of the more important features that differ our folders from other folders is the bottom strap, which is attached at the outside base of the folder. This gives three benefits: more room inside; page turns that don&#39;t scrape against the strap; and lastly, a bookmark: that bottom strap angles in at 45 degrees when closing the folder, to act as a bookmark for impromptu bows during concerts - with no panic at the next upbeat - because you&#39;re on the right page when the folder opens again.<br>
<br>
The folder has a comfortable hand strap at back for you to hold it securely, and the deeply-textured leatherette aids in dissipating perspiration from your hand if you are performing under hot stage lights. <br>
<br>
A side-expanding pocket at right can store surplus music. All folders include a name card pocket and name card, and hold US Letter and A4 and all common score sizes with ease. Having only one booster tab at the bottom means that taller European A4 music punched in North American 3-hole style will not bump a ring booster tab at the top.<br>
<br>
Finally, a clear pocket is included at left; you can read your concert program or church service bulletin through the transparent pocket, instead of having to pull it up to see the lower portion of the page. It&#39;s also handy for notes such as changes in standing order and rehearsal plans for directors. Photos, especially from choirs that tour, tend to end up in that clear pocket too. <br>
<br>
Other countries don&#39;t necessarily use 3-ring adaptors; so below you can choose MUSICFOLDER.com RingBinder folders with 2-ring or 4-ring adaptors which are 19 mm in diameter. These are initially available in limited quantity.<br>

                            The PocketTones Pitch Pipe is the perfect pitch accessory to add to your keychain to give accurate pitch for practice or concerts.<br>
<br>
It has a volume control to allow a discreet pitch for only you to hear, or a good loud tone that will carry for a larger choir. You don&#39;t have to suck the lint out before blowing into an acoustic pitch pipe or wonder whether the last person to borrow it was in good health!<br>
<br>
It&#39;s handy, durable, compact, and this inexpensive 12-note version is ideal for voice or instruments. You can give notes of a chord in quick succession as well. Batteries included (AG-13).<br>
<br>
Directions: <br>
1. Press desired note button to turn pitch ON.<br>
2. Press same note button again to turn OFF.<br>
3. Adjust volume as needed by rotating knob on side of unit<br>
4. Auto shut-off feature after 15 seconds.<br>

                            This clip-on (or free-standing) light has a bright super-L.E.D. bulb that never needs replacing and gives up to 50 hours per set of 3 AAA batteries, which are included.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s incredibly light; casts an even beam, has an adjustable stem to position it exactly where you want. The padded clip holds securely to a thin folder or a thick piano stand with equal ease.<br>
<br>
For touring to venues where you&#39;re unsure of lighting conditions, or the savings in time and shipping of setting up bulky extension cords and light sets, having one of these lights in your Gig Bag is always a bright idea. <br>
<br>
NEW! Just added: XtraFlex DUET has 2 heads for wider light dispersion especially for conductors who have their music flat and thus opened wider. Batteries not included in the DUET, but it has a lifetime of up to 20 hours with 3 AAA batteries. Any choir that ever performs away from its usual location should keep one or two of these handy for the director or accompanist at minimum, for poorly lit venues, or that afternoon dress rehearsal on tour that you find is just not so bright in the evening concert.<br>

Imprinting typically adds up to 5 business days to your order; from mid-August to November allow up to 10 business days. <br>
 <br>
<br>
The normal colour for imprinting is gold, to match the black-and-gold/brass colour styling of the folders.<br>
<br>
However, most other colours are available by request, on regular text imprinting and logo imprinting.<br>
<br>
At the ordering stage on the web shopping cart, where contact information is entered, use the &quot;Special Instructions&quot; box at the bottom to write your text for imprinting, or the starting number for numbering (if it is not &quot;1&quot;).<br>

              The Black Folder has utility beyond the use by <br>
choirs for which it was designed.  <br>
Pharmaceutical <br>
companies use it as an elegant binder for their <br>
sales force to hold new product descriptions, <br>
and <br>
teachers or presenters can also securely and <br>
comfortably hold materials in one hand, leaving <br>
the other free to write, point, and give more <br>
effective presentations.

                Key / Major clients:
              </h4>
           
              Top choirs across the world have heard of or use The Black Folder. Distributors from Carus-Verlag in Germany to Pana Musica in Japan allow musicians the greater ease of obtaining our product locally.
            
            
        
                
       
    
    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Sales have increased by and average of over 25% <br>
each year in the past 4 years.  Design <br>
improvements and quality service have made this <br>
product so popular that we have cut back on <br>
advertising as we develop on-line solutions and <br>
manage growth to retain the same level of <br>
service.
