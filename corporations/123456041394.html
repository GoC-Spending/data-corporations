                            Maxim personnel offer many years of Canadian experience in the <br>
field of Transportation Engineering.  We have been responsible <br>
for planning, design, and construction supervision of street <br>
systems, highways, grade separation structures and traffic <br>
interchanges.  In addition, we have performed rehabilitation <br>
studies, and ratings for municipal road systems.  Our staff <br>
includes personnel with specialized experience in the design and <br>
construction of streets and highways.<br>
<br>
Typically projects include:<br>
<br>
1. ALBERTA TRANSPORTATION &amp; UTILITIES<br>
   LOG HAUL AND WEIGH-SCALE INTERSECTION DESIGN<br>
<br>
   As part of a functional planning and public consultation <br>
   assignment for Alberta Transportation &amp; Utilities, Maxim <br>
   Engineering designed an intersection at the intersection<br>
   of a secondary and a primary highway at Drayton Valley that <br>
   included provision for turning logging trucks and access to a <br>
   self-weigh scale site.<br>

   Client: Alberta Transportation &amp; Utilities<br>
<br>
   Year:   1996<br>
<br>
   Estimated    <br>
   Capital Cost: $1,000,000<br>
<br>
2. TOWN OF MILLET - STREET REHABILITATION PROGRAM<br>
<br>
   In 1994 Maxim Engineering Inc. prepared a feasibility study <br>
   and cost estimate for the Town streets rehabilitation program.<br>
   The Town&#39;s intent was to utilize the        <br>
   Federal/Provincial/Municipal infrastructure program to upgrade<br>
   from their existing gravel and cold mix asphalt streets to a <br>
   hot mix asphalt road surface with new curbs and walks.  Maxim<br>
   staff worked within the Town&#39;s budget to design the drainage <br>
   and road systems, tendered the project and supervised <br>
   construction during 1994.  The construction project required <br>
   stripping and re-use of cold mix aggregate for fill <br>
   replacement of unsuitable subgrade material, removal of <br>
   unsuitable sidewalks, replacement of curbs, gutters and <br>
   walkways, installation of new curbs and gutters,   <br>
   installation of geotextile mat to stabilize poor subgrade soil<br>
   conditions, and coordinating existing irregular lot grades. <br>

                            During the past 5 years Morrison Hershfield Limited engineers <br>
and technologists have assisted the forest industry with site <br>
development including log yards, gantry crane runways &amp; <br>
installation, drainage, lumber yards and forestry roadways.<br>
<br>
Typically projects have included:<br>
<br>
1. TOLKO INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
   HIGH PRAIRIE OSB MILL<br>
   LOG YARD AND GANTRY CRANE TRACKAGE<br>
<br>
   Tolko Industries Ltd. of Vernon, British Columbia was <br>
   awarded the timber rights for the High Prairie Timber <br>
   Development Area.  As a result, Tolko has built a 450 million<br>
   square foot (3/8&quot; basis) Oriented Strand Board (OSB) Mill at <br>
   High Prairie, Alberta.<br>
<br>
   To handle the raw logs in the wood yard it was decided to <br>
   install a portal gantry crane which has a 205 foot span,<br>
   85 foot cantilevers and lifts 30 tons.  The supply of the <br>
   crane, log yard development and crane trackage was awarded to <br>
   Kone Wood.  Morrison Hershfield Limited sub-contracted by <br>
Kone Wood to engineer, design &amp; construct the log yard and crane <br>
trackage.<br>
<br>
   Detail engineering was carried out with the results that the <br>
   project&#39;s final configuration involved moving 120,000 Cu.Yd. <br>
   of gravel placement, 6,000 lin. feet of sub-drains, drainage <br>
   ditches, culverts, lift stations, 500 feet of reinforced earth<br>
   retaining wall, 1,500 feet of gantry crane trackage, concrete <br>
   pavement and safety barriers, and miscellaneous structures.<br>
<br>
   A project of this nature required the involvement of a <br>
   multi-discipline engineering and contracting approach and the <br>
   team that Morrison Hershfield Limited assembled involved a <br>
full range of heavy civil engineering and construction firms.  <br>
<br>
After three years of operations, a forest fire Northwest of the <br>
Tolko High Prairie OSB Mill spread to the log yard destroying <br>
the log inventory and the gantry crane.  Morrison Hershfield <br>
Limited was then commissioned immediately to provide cost <br>
estimates and plans for replacing the crane.<br>
<br>
Once the immediate needs had been met, the destruction of the <br>
log handling equipment afforded Tolko with the opportunity to <br>
reassess the use of a gantry crane vs conventional mobile <br>
equipment.  Working very closely with Tolko personnel, Morrison <br>
Hershfield Limited carried out a study on available log handling <br>
systems.  The written report, which resulted from the study, was <br>
presented to the Owners of Tolko who then made the final <br>
decision on the log handling system.<br>
<br>
2. ZEIDLER FOREST INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
   LOG YARD DEVELOPMENT<br>
<br>
   Morrison Hershfield Limited has been commissioned by Zeidler <br>
to carry out a study on the log handling systems available and to<br>
   determine which system would be best for Zeidler&#39;s Slave Lake <br>
   Veneer Mill and Sawmill.<br>
<br>
   In addition to the log yard, also included in the review was <br>
   the use and upgrading of the lumber yards, peeler handing    <br>
   area, plant roads and travelling area.  Alternative yard <br>
   layouts were developed, cost estimates prepared, advantages<br>
   and disadvantages reported.<br>
<br>
3. VANDERWELL&#39;S MITSUE SAWMILL<br>
   SITE DEVELOPMENT<br>
<br>
   PHASE 1 - LOG YARD AND GANTRY CRANE TRACKAGE<br>
<br>
   For a number of years the operation at Vanderwell&#39;s Mitsue <br>
   Sawmill has been hindered by very poor site conditions for <br>
   storing and moving logs to the sawmill.  This resulted in <br>
   Vanderwell ordering a gantry crane for the handling of logs.<br>
   Vanderwell then commissioned Morrison Hershfield to review<br>
   alternatives and prepare a conceptual design for the gantry<br>
   crane trackage, overall log yard and general site <br>
   improvements.  Once these alternatives were presented and <br>
   Vanderwell chose the best alternatives for their position, <br>
   Morrison Hershfield Limited then proceeded with the detailed <br>
design, assisted with ordering materials, and managed the <br>
construction of the facilities.<br>
<br>
   PHASE 2 - LUMBER YARD PAVEMENT<br>
<br>
   During the winter of 1998, a gravel source was obtained and a <br>
   crushing contract let to prepare 150,000 tonnes of aggregate<br>
   for the paving of the lumber handling areas of the sawmill <br>
   site.  During June and July, the earthworks were carried out<br>
   preparing the site for roller compacted concrete surfacing<br>
   of the lumber handling area.<br>
<br>
   The roller compacted contract has been awarded and 82,000 m <br>
   sq. of roller compacted concrete will be placed in August, <br>
   1998.  <br>
<br>
   This will complete the re-development of the sawmill site <br>
   over a two year period totalling approximately $7,500,000.<br>

1. TOWN OF WAINWRIGHT<br>
   MUNICIPAL ENGINEERING SERVICES<br>
<br>
From 1990 through 2001, Morrison Hershfield has provided full <br>
engineering services for the Town of Wainwright.  These projects <br>
have included approximately 150 lots for single family housing, <br>
multiple family complexes, mobile home subdivisions and <br>
apartment buildings as well as the upgrading of its sewage <br>
treatment facilities.  This sewage treatment-upgrading project <br>
included construction of a new aerated complete mix cell, <br>
replacement of the aeration system in the existing cells and <br>
installation of a new blower/motor and new manhole/control <br>
structures associated with piping and sewers.  Construction of <br>
this project was completed during the summer of 1993.<br>
In addition to these civil engineering assignments, Morrison <br>
Hershfield has provided building engineering services, including <br>
electrical, instrumentation and mechanical engineering for a <br>
retrofit of the firehall.  Mechanical, electrical and <br>
instrumentation engineering services were also provided for <br>
upgrading of the control and telemetry system for the Wainwright <br>
Regional Water Treatment Plant, which is located at the Canadian <br>
Forces Base Wainwright.<br>
In 1998-99 Morrison Hershfield provided design engineering for <br>
the approval and construction of a major stormwater drainage <br>
system which services the centre and business section of town.  <br>
The existing system was undersized and causing frequent flooding <br>
during the summer months.<br>
The new system, with a total length of 3000m, was comprised of <br>
three elements:  pipe, ditching and two stormwater detention <br>
ponds.  Because of limited clearances with existing utilities, <br>
round and arch CMP pipe was used, ranging in size from 750 mm to <br>
1790 X 1360 arch. <br>
Currently, MH is carrying out a complete water network analysis <br>
having done a sanitary sewer system and stormwater drainage <br>
analysis over the last few years. Also at the present time, MH <br>
is designing two new subdivisions and an extension of servicing <br>
for a new institutional facility site.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
Morrison Hershfield Limited was contracted by the World Bank and <br>
the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to    <br>
complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential   <br>
sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries    <br>
of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,    <br>
St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was   <br>
to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to    <br>
develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The  <br>
final report included an outline of what each country has to<br>
do in order to implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
   <br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal<br>
     of sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity <br>
to   operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with <br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy for<br>
     identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability and <br>
     willingness to pay.  In the context of developing countries,<br>
     household income and preferences govern whether a community <br>
     wants and can afford to implement any type of a sewage <br>
     system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December 1996.<br>

2. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   Morrison Hershfield Limited was commissioned by the City  <br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling    <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance<br>
     system;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility has been approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. has been <br>
included into the project.  The composting facility impacted<br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project <br>
because sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL), must <br>
now be delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to <br>
CBL. <br>
<br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Morrison Hershfield  <br>
has worked closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate <br>
transporting sludge and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and <br>
to meet the operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements <br>
to the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing <br>
and the mutual economic benefits to the City of Celanese. <br>
<br>
Inclusion of this second new pipeline doubled the total project <br>
cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.  The project is now <br>
complete.<br>

1. GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA<br>
   WATER PUMPING STATIONS/FACILITIES REHABILITATION<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by Guyana Water <br>
   Authority (GUYWA) to prepare preliminary rehabilitation<br>
   designs for thirty-five (35) water pumping stations/facilities <br>
   and detailed designs including preparation of bidding <br>
   documents for ten (10) pumping stations/facilities as part of<br>
   the World Bank funded Water Supply Technical Assistance and <br>
   Rehabilitation Project.  The programme objective with respect <br>
   to pumping stations/facilities is rehabilitation of exisiting <br>
   systems that have fallen into various states of disrepair over<br>
   a number of years as a direct result of insufficient <br>
   maintenance.<br>
<br>
   During the initial conditions inspections in late March, 1993, <br>
   it became apparent that a number of the 35 stations that had <br>
   been selected by GUYWA for pre-design were interconnected to <br>
   adjacent pumping stations/facilities.  The extent of the <br>
   interconnections was confirmed in June when it was determined<br>
   that the original list of 35 stations impacted on a total of <br>
   86 facilities.<br>
<br>
   The presence of extensive interconnected systems meant that <br>
   the World Bank&#39;s original programme strategy to rehabilitate<br>
   individual pumping stations/facilities was no longer cost <br>
   effective.  Maxim Engineering Inc. developed a new approach <br>
   focusing on rehabilitation of interconnected systems with an<br>
   emphasis on reducing the overall number of pumping stations <br>
   and associated operating and maintenance costs.<br>
<br>
   Maxim finalized the pre-design reports for 7 major water <br>
   supply/treatment rehabilitation schemes (including complete   <br>
   distribution system reconstruction) servicing a total <br>
   population of 160,000.  We subsequently finalized detailed<br>
   rehabilitation designs and bidding documents for 6 water <br>
   treatment plants, 4 elevated storage towers, 27 water pumping<br>
   stations and associated interconnecting transmission mains for<br>
   the 7 systems.<br>
<br>
   In addition, Maxim was commissioned to conduct a site <br>
   evaluation of the existing Water Treatment Plant at Bartica<br>
   on the west bank of the Essiquibo River.  We were then <br>
   authorized to prepare a pre-design study, tender documents and <br>
   specifications for complete rehabilitation of the water <br>
   treatment plant.<br>

2. TOWN OF MILLET<br>
   WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION STUDY<br>
<br>
   The Town of Millet, with a population of 2,000, uses a       <br>
   water distribution network supplied by a central reservoir<br>
   which in turn is supplied by ground water wells.  A barely<br>
   sufficient water supply capacity and low system pressures<br>
   warranted an overall Water Supply and Distribution Study.<br>
<br>
   Data was collected and reviewed to assess the existing water <br>
   supply capacity.  Future Town populations were then projected<br>
   to identify future water supply needs.  The distribution <br>
   system was modelled utilizing the &quot;WATER&quot; computer program <br>
   and later calibrated using flow and system pressure data <br>
   collected in the field.  The calibrated model was used to <br>
   identify system modifications required to boost system <br>
   pressures now and in the future and to simulate future <br>
   expansion of the distribution system.  Recommendations for<br>
   phased construction of system and supply modifications were<br>
   submitted in report form.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to submission of our report, the Town commissioned<br>
   Maxim to retain a groundwater hydrologist to identify and <br>
   complete a suitable additional well water supply and <br>
   authorized Maxim to connect the wells to the existing <br>
   reservoir.  The new wells also generated upgrading of water<br>
   treatment plant controls and the installation of a new<br>
   distribution pump.  Maxim provided design plans and <br>
   specifications, received construction tenders, reviewed and<br>
   recommended for contract award and provided construction <br>
   inspection and contract administration.<br>

3. RESERVOIR REHABILITATION<br>
   TOWN OF EDSON<br>
<br>
   Maxim carried out site investigation work and prepared a <br>
   detailed feasibility study for upgrading the five potable     <br>
   water reservoirs for the Town of Edson.  These reservoir    <br>
   structures included an elevated steel tower and tank <br>
   (100 ft - 50,000 imperial gallon capacity), two underground   <br>
   concrete tanks, one above ground concrete tank <br>
   (75 ft diameter x 30 ft high), and one above ground steel<br>
   tank (60 ft diameter x 30 ft high).  Only minor upgrading was <br>
   recommended for the concrete structures.  The steel reservoirs<br>
   however were in need of significant rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
   Following acceptance of our recommendations, Maxim was <br>
   commissioned to prepare the necessary design, to tender the<br>
   project, and to provide construction inspection and project<br>
   management services.  Remedial work included installation of <br>
   new foundation systems, sandblasting of steel, installation of <br>
   new fibreglass and epoxy liners, and new insulation for <br>
   exterior surfaces.<br>

4. CAMP WAINWRIGHT (DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE)<br>
   WATER PRODUCTION SYSTEM AUTOMATION STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim was commissioned to study the potable water production <br>
   facilities located on Camp Wainwright to determine how to <br>
   automate the system to enable production hours to be expanded<br>
   from 12 to 24 hours while reducing required operating hours <br>
   from 12 to eight.<br>
<br>
   The existing system includes a river intake pumping station <br>
   which pumps raw water to a large raw water storage reservoir <br>
   (lake).  A conventional 1.5 MGD water treatment plant treats<br>
   raw water from the lake using clarification and filtration, <br>
   and then pumps the potable water to an underground storage<br>
   reservoir.  Booster pumps deliver the water, through metering<br>
   stations which monitor the flows, from the underground storage<br>
   to elevated storage reservoirs at the Town of Wainwright and <br>
   at Camp Central.<br>
<br>
   The water treatment plant has a programmable logic controller <br>
   (PLC) in which the automatic mode has not reliably operated<br>
   since installation.  A telemetry system uses several terminal <br>
   units (RTU&#39;s) to link all the facilities to the water <br>
   treatment plant, except for the river pumping station which<br>
   is independently operated.  The RTU&#39;s do not operate   <br>
   reliably.<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel visited the site several times to collect <br>
   data, receive input from system operating personnel and <br>
   camp engineers, and share ideas.  As a result, Maxim personnel<br>
   gained a comprehensive understanding of the system and the <br>
   client&#39;s goals.  From this, a simple clear report was written<br>
   which identified the required changes to the existing control <br>
   and telemetry system, and to areas of the process in order to <br>
   automate the plant.<br>
<br>
   Changes to the control system included upgrading and <br>
   re-programming the PLC to provide automatic operation,<br>
   installing a user friendly computerized Man Machine Interface<br>
   (MMI) to assist operators to control, track and manage the <br>
   system, installing new reliable RTU&#39;s to relay information    <br>
   from all the remote facilities over existing telephone lines<br>
   to the PLC and the MMI.  Changes to the process included <br>
   installing new pumps, valves, and instrumentation to support<br>
   24 hour operation.<br>
<br>
   The report was well received and implementation of the <br>
   recommendations was completed with Maxim providing general<br>
   engineering services during construction.<br>

1. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s aerated lagoon expansion.  The <br>
   project was constructed during the summer of 1993.  The<br>
   lagoon expansion included construction of a new aerated <br>
   complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system in the <br>
   existing facultative cells, new blower/motor installation and <br>
   new manhole/control structures including all associated piping<br>
   and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide <br>
   mixing and oxygen entrainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.  An additional 192 new static <br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals<br>
   for construction.<br>

2. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to    <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential    <br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries  <br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, <br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was  <br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies   <br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The  <br>
   final report included an outline of what each country has to  <br>
   do in order to implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal<br>
     of sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation <br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to<br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated      <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water<br>
     and Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
   <br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy <br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing<br>
     countries, household income and preferences govern whether<br>
     a community wants and can afford to implement any type of <br>
     a sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

3. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City <br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
     systsem;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility has been approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. has been <br>
included into the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual ecomomic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline doubled the total project cost from <br>
$2.5 million to $5 million.  The project is now completed.<br>

4. SUMMER VILLAGES OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the<br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy<br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, 35 <br>
   km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird<br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project inlcuded determination of design flows based upon <br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

   MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter <br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the <br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed <br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to<br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

2. TOWN OF MILLET - STREET REHABILITATION PROGRAM<br>
<br>
   In 1994 Maxim Engineering Inc. prepared a feasibility study <br>
   and cost estimate for the Town streets rehabilitation program.<br>
   The Town&#39;s intent was to utilize the        <br>
   Federal/Provincial/Municipal infrastructure program to upgrade<br>
   from their existing gravel and cold mix asphalt streets to a <br>
   hot mix asphalt road surface with new curbs and walks.  Maxim<br>
   staff worked within the Town&#39;s budget to design the drainage <br>
   and road systems, tendered the project and supervised <br>
   construction during 1994.  The construction project required <br>
   stripping and re-use of cold mix aggregate for fill <br>
   replacement of unsuitable subgrade material, removal of <br>
   unsuitable sidewalks, replacement of curbs, gutters and <br>
   walkways, installation of new curbs and gutters,   <br>
   installation of geotextile mat to stabilize poor subgrade soil<br>
   conditions, and coordinating existing irregular lot grades. <br>

<br>
   A current project that Maxim has for Alberta Transportation &amp; <br>
   Utilities is the 1997 Seal Coat Program for their <br>
   North-Central Region (Barrhead).<br>
<br>
   The project consists of the application of over 700,000 square <br>
   metres of seal coat along seven sections of primary highway <br>
   and six bridge structures.  Included, for the first time in<br>
   any seal coat contract, is a provision for the repair of all <br>
   minor surface defects, including pothole patching.  When <br>
   completed, this project will have involved over 190 <br>
   lane-kilometres of highway ranging from border-to-border in <br>
   North-Central Alberta.<br>

Typical projects are as follows:<br>
<br>
1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
The most efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound <br>
manner of disposal of oilfield/industrial waste is to develop a <br>
Class 1a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
During the spring and summer of 1996 Byram Industrial Services <br>
Ltd. (BISL) identified several possible sites and through a <br>
preliminary screening of geological characteristics identified a <br>
good site for a Class 1a Hazardous Waste Industrial Landfill.  <br>
After preliminary discussions with Alberta Environment (AEVN) <br>
and public meetings with local residents, a Project Disclosure <br>
Document was published and distributed to the general public, <br>
interested third parties and AEVN.  Under the Alberta <br>
Environmental Protection Act a Class 1a landfill is a mandatory <br>
activity that requires a full Environmental Impact Assessment <br>
(EIA) be carried out.  This EIA was carried out and submitted to <br>
AEVN in December 1997. <br>
<br>
Once the EIA was accepted as complete, the Application to <br>
Construct, Operate and Reclaim the landfill was prepared and <br>
submitted in July 1998. <br>
<br>
Throughout this process a Coalition of Environmental groups <br>
monitored the complete process and in October 1998 a specially <br>
prepared document addressing their specific concerns was <br>
prepared and submitted to these special interest groups.<br>
The approval for the construction of the landfill was obtained <br>
from AEVN on April 21, 1999 and construction of the facilities <br>
started in early May.  The construction took 5 months and the <br>
landfill went into operation in early September 1999.  The <br>
landfill consists of the following facilities on 300 hectares of <br>
land:<br>
Þ Access road<br>
Þ Scales, office and laboratory<br>
Þ Run-on and runoff drainage control<br>
Þ Monitoring wells, terrestrial sample plots, aquatic life <br>
sampling plots and monitoring facilities.<br>
Þ A 100 metre by 100 metre first disposal cell<br>
Þ The necessary support facilities<br>
The site has been conceptually approved for 32 similar sized <br>
cells and it is anticipated that it will have a life of twenty-<br>
five to thirty years.<br>
<br>
2. TOWN OF WAINWRIGHT<br>
   MUNICIPAL ENGINEERING SERVICES<br>
<br>
From 1990 through 2001, Morrison Hershfield has provided full <br>
engineering services for the Town of Wainwright.  These projects <br>
have included approximately 150 lots for single family housing, <br>
multiple family complexes, mobile home subdivisions and <br>
apartment buildings as well as the upgrading of its sewage <br>
treatment facilities.  This sewage treatment-upgrading project <br>
included construction of a new aerated complete mix cell, <br>
replacement of the aeration system in the existing cells and <br>
installation of a new blower/motor and new manhole/control <br>
structures associated with piping and sewers.  Construction of <br>
this project was completed during the summer of 1993.<br>
<br>
In addition to these civil engineering assignments, Morrison <br>
Hershfield has provided building engineering services, including <br>
electrical, instrumentation and mechanical engineering for a <br>
retrofit of the firehall.  Mechanical, electrical and <br>
instrumentation engineering services were also provided for <br>
upgrading of the control and telemetry system for the Wainwright <br>
Regional Water Treatment Plant, which is located at the Canadian <br>
Forces Base Wainwright.<br>
<br>
In 1998-99 Morrison Hershfield provided design engineering for <br>
the approval and construction of a major stormwater drainage <br>
system which services the centre and business section of town.  <br>
The existing system was undersized and causing frequent flooding <br>
during the summer months.<br>
<br>
The new system, with a total length of 3000m, was comprised of <br>
three elements:  pipe, ditching and two stormwater detention <br>
ponds.  Because of limited clearances with existing utilities, <br>
round and arch CMP pipe was used, ranging in size from 750 mm to <br>
1790 X 1360 arch.<br>
 <br>
Currently, MH is carrying out a complete water network analysis <br>
having done a sanitary sewer system and stormwater drainage <br>
analysis over the last few years. Also at the present time, MH <br>
is designing two new subdivisions and an extension of servicing <br>
for a new institutional facility site.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
Morrison Hershfield Limited was contracted by the World Bank and <br>
the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to    <br>
complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential    <br>
sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries <br>
of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,   <br>
St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was<br>
to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal of <br>
     sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity <br>
to <br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkage with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy<br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing <br>
     countries, household income and preference govern whether a<br>
     community wants and can afford to implement any type of a <br>
     sewage system.<br>
<br>
The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report   <br>
was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE <br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
The project involved the upgrading of the sewage sludge and <br>
liquid effluent handling system. During 1996, the liquid <br>
decanting system improvements were implemented, the sludge <br>
pumping equipment was purchased and commissioned, the existing <br>
pipelines were externally investigated and one section had the <br>
internal investigation completed.  The pre-design, design, EIA <br>
and construction of 5 km of new pipeline were completed in 1997.<br>
<br>
Subsequent to having been awarded the project, the TransAlta Co-<br>
Composter Facility was approved by City Council.  In addition, <br>
Celanese Canada requested a tie-in to the City sewage system.   <br>
These two events added substantially to the project by adding a <br>
second crossing of the river with an outfall from Celanese and <br>
changing the piping and valving so that sludge and filtrate <br>
could be delivered to the Co-Composter. Also designed and <br>
constructed was the piping and valving to enable the City to <br>
reclaim sludge and filtrate from the lagoons and deliver it to <br>
the Co-Composter.  Morrison Hershfield staff worked closely with <br>
Celanese and TransAlta personnel as well as the client, the City <br>
of Edmonton, to successfully design, construct and commission <br>
the reclaim system, pipeline and transfer valving.<br>
<br>
The new 250mm Dia. HDPE wastewater disposal pipeline for <br>
Celanese was included into the project because of the similar <br>
technical requirements to the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, <br>
the concurrent timing and the mutual economic benefits to the <br>
City and Celanese.  <br>
<br>
The installation of the pipelines was completed in 1997, with <br>
the Saskatchewan River crossing accomplished by the directional <br>
drilling method for both the steel and HDPE lines. Morrison <br>
Hershfield provided the design, contract drawings and <br>
specifications, project management and construction engineering <br>
services for the total project.<br>

<br>
Typical projects are as follows:<br>
<br>
1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
   As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
   depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
   de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil <br>
   drill pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other<br>
   oilfield wastes will require rehabilitation and in most cases,<br>
   disposal in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The most<br>
   efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound manner<br>
   of disposal for this oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a <br>
   Class-1 a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
   Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
   team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for  <br>
   the proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of    <br>
   hydrologists, geologists, environmentalists, landscape    <br>
   architects, biologists and public relations sub-consultants.  <br>
   Maxim&#39;s team completed the Public Disclosure and Public    <br>
   Information phase of the project in December 1996 and    <br>
   submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment and conceptual <br>
   design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
   Maxim prepared the detail design and application for Alberta <br>
   Environmental approval.  Approval has been received.  The    <br>
   landfill is scheduled for construction during the second half <br>
   of 1998.<br>
<br>
2. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment aerated lagoon     <br>
   expansion.  The project was constructed during the summer of  <br>
   1993.  The lagoon expansion included construction of a new    <br>
   aerated complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system <br>
   in the existing facultative cells, new blower/motor    <br>
   installation and new manhole/control structures including all <br>
   associated piping and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide<br>
   mixing and oxygen entrainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.   An additional 192 new static<br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals for<br>
   construction.<br>

3. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and  <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential <br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries <br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,<br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was<br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal of <br>
     sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to <br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkage with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy<br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing <br>
     countries, household income and preference govern whether a<br>
     community wants and can afford to implement any type of a <br>
     sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE <br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
 - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
   systems;<br>
<br>
 - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
  <br>
 - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
   8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons<br>
   and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
 - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre <br>
   long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
   a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially <br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
composting facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilities transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

5. SUMMER VILLAGE OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy  <br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake,<br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environment impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird <br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>
<br>

 <br>
   Year:   1990 - 1991<br>
   <br>
   Cost:   $400,000<br>
<br>
6. MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs for the resort and to satisfy the Federal  <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified<br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter<br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the<br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed<br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to <br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and<br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential<br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries<br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, <br>
   St. Vincent &amp; Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was to <br>
   identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies<br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal of <br>
     sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to<br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy for<br>
     identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability and <br>
     willingness to pay.  In the context of developing countries,<br>
     household income and preference govern whether a community<br>
     wants and can afford to implement any type of a sewage <br>
     system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling  <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance<br>
     systems;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter  <br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially <br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and the pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility was approved, <br>
Maxim has worked closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate <br>
transporting sludge and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and <br>
to meet the operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

5. SUMMER VILLAGE OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE <br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy<br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, <br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Barid<br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

6. MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of he <br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter<br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the <br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed <br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to <br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The<br>
   system is complete an in operation.<br>

<br>
1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
   As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
   depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
   de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil    <br>
   drill pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other   <br>
   oilfield wastes will require rehabilitation and in most cases, <br>
   disposal in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The most   <br>
   efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound manner <br>
   of disposal for this oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a <br>
   Class-1 a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
   Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
   team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for  <br>
   the proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of    <br>
   hydrologists, geologists, environmentalists, landscape    <br>
   architects, biologists and public relations sub-consultants.  <br>
   Maxim&#39;s team completed the Public Disclosure and Public    <br>
   Information phase of the project in December 1996 and    <br>
   submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment and conceptual <br>
   design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
   Maxim prepared the detail design and application for Alberta <br>
   Environmental approval.  Approval has been received.  The    <br>
   landfill is scheduled for construction during the second half <br>
   of 1998.<br>
<br>
2. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment aerated lagoon     <br>
   expansion.  The project was constructed during the summer of  <br>
   1993.  The lagoon expansion included construction of a new    <br>
   aerated complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system <br>
   in the existing facultative cells, new blower/motor    <br>
   installation and new manhole/control structures including all <br>
   associated piping and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide<br>
   mixing and oxygen entrainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.   An additional 192 new static<br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals for<br>
   construction.<br>

3. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and  <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential <br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries <br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,<br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was<br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal of <br>
     sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to <br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkage with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy<br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing <br>
     countries, household income and preference govern whether a<br>
     community wants and can afford to implement any type of a <br>
     sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE <br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
 - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
   systems;<br>
<br>
 - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
  <br>
 - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
   8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons<br>
   and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
 - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre <br>
   long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
   a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially <br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
composting facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilities transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

5. SUMMER VILLAGE OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy  <br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake,<br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environment impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird <br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

6. MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs for the resort and to satisfy the Federal  <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified<br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter<br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the<br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed<br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to <br>

1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
   As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
   depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
   de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil    <br>
   drill pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other   <br>
   oilfield wastes will require rehabilitation and in most cases, <br>
   disposal in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The most   <br>
   efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound manner <br>
   of disposal for this oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a <br>
   Class 1-a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
   Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
   team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for  <br>
   the proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of       <br>
   hydrologists, geologists, environmentalists, landscape       <br>
   architects, biologists and public relations sub-consultants.  <br>
   <br>
   Maxim&#39;s team completed the Public Disclosure and Public       <br>
   Information phase of the project in December 1996 and       <br>
   submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment and conceptual  <br>
   design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
   Currently Maxim is preparing the detail design and application <br>
   for Alberta Environmental approval.  The landfill if scheduled <br>
   for construction during the second half of 1998.<br>
<br>
2. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering<br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment aerated lagoon <br>
   expansion.  The project was constructed during the summer of <br>
   1993.  The lagoon expansion included construction of a new <br>
   aerated complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system<br>
   in the existing facultative cells, new blower/motor<br>
   installation and new manhole/control structures including<br>
   all associated piping and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide<br>
   mixing and oxygen entrainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.  An additional 192 new static<br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by<br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air<br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals<br>
   for construction.<br>

3. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential<br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries<br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,<br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was <br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate<br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal<br>
     of sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based<br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to<br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and <br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy<br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing a <br>
     community wants and can afford to implement any type of a <br>
     sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report<br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance<br>
     systems;<br>
   <br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre <br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially<br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and the pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.)<br>
Composting Facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

5. SUMMER VILLAGE OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy  <br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, <br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird <br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with <br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

6. MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin<br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National <br>
   Park.  Subsequent to the preparation of a study which <br>
   identified alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs<br>
   and tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter<br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the <br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed <br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to<br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
 - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
   systems;<br>
<br>
 - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
  <br>
 - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
   8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons<br>
   and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
 - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre <br>
   long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
   a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially <br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
composting facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilities transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

5. SUMMER VILLAGE OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy  <br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake,<br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environment impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird <br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

6. MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs for the resort and to satisfy the Federal  <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified<br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter<br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the<br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed<br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to <br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
   As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
   depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
   de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil    <br>
   drill pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other   <br>
   oilfield wastes will require proceeding and in most cases,    <br>
   disposal in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The most   <br>
   efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound manner <br>
   of disposal for this oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a <br>
   Class 1 a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
   Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
   team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for  <br>
   the proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of    <br>
   hydrologists, geologists, environmentalists, landscape    <br>
   architects, biologists and public relations sub-consultants.  <br>
   Maxim&#39;s team completed the Public Disclosure and Public    <br>
   Information phase of the project in December 1996 and    <br>
   submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment and conceptual <br>
   design December, 1997.<br>

1. GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA<br>
   WATER PUMPING STATIONS/FACILITIES REHABILITATION<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by Guyana Water <br>
   Authority (GUYWA) to prepare preliminary rehabilitation<br>
   designs for thirty-five (35) water pumping stations/facilities <br>
   and detailed designs including preparation of bidding <br>
   documents for ten (10) pumping stations/facilities as part of<br>
   the World Bank funded Water Supply Technical Assistance and<br>
   Rehabilitation Project.  The programme objective with respect <br>
   to pumping stations/facilities is rehabilitation of existing <br>
   systems that have fallen into various states of disrepair over<br>
   a number of years as a direct result of insufficient <br>
   maintenance.<br>
<br>
   During the initial conditions inspections in late March, 1993, <br>
   it became apparent that a number of the 35 stations that had <br>
   been selected by GUYWA for pre-design were interconnected to <br>
   adjacent pumping stations/facilities.  The extent of the <br>
   interconnections was confirmed in June when it was determined<br>
   that the original list of 35 stations impacted on a total of <br>
   86 facilities.<br>
<br>
   The presence of extensive interconnected systems meant that <br>
   the World Bank&#39;s original programme strategy to rehabilitate<br>
   individual pumping stations/facilities was no longer cost <br>
   effective.  Maxim Engineering Inc. developed a new approach <br>
   focusing on rehabilitation of interconnected systems with an<br>
   emphasis on reducing the overall number of pumping stations <br>
   and associated operating and maintenance costs.<br>
<br>
   Maxim finalized the pre-design reports for 7 major water <br>
   supply/treatment rehabilitation schemes (including complete   <br>
   distribution system reconstruction) servicing a total <br>
   population of 160,000.  We subsequently finalized detailed<br>
   rehabilitation designs and bidding documents for 6 water <br>
   treatment plants, 4 elevated storage towers, 27 water pumping<br>
   stations and associated interconnecting transmission mains for<br>
   the 7 systems.<br>
<br>
   In addition, Maxim was commissioned to conduct a site <br>
   evaluation of the existing Water Treatment Plant at Bartica<br>
   on the west bank of the Essiquibo River.  We were then <br>
   authorized to prepare a pre-design study, tender documents and <br>
   specifications for complete rehabilitation of the water <br>
   treatment plant.<br>

2. TOWN OF MILLET<br>
   WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION STUDY<br>
<br>
   The Town of Millet, with a population of 2,000, uses a       <br>
   water distribution network supplied by a central reservoir<br>
   which in turn is supplied by ground water wells.  A barely<br>
   sufficient water supply capacity and low system pressures<br>
   warranted an overall Water Supply and Distribution Study.<br>
<br>
   Data was collected and reviewed to assess the existing water <br>
   supply capacity.  Future Town populations were then projected<br>
   to identify future water supply needs.  The distribution <br>
   system was modelled utilizing the &quot;WATER&quot; computer program <br>
   and later calibrated using flow and system pressure data <br>
   collected in the field.  The calibrated model was used to <br>
   identify system modifications required to boost system <br>
   pressures now and in the future and to simulate future <br>
   expansion of the distribution system.  Recommendations for<br>
   phased construction of system and supply modifications were<br>
   submitted in report form.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to submission of our report, the Town commissioned<br>
   Maxim to retain a groundwater hydrologist to identify and <br>
   complete a suitable additional well water supply and <br>
   authorized Maxim to connect the wells to the existing <br>
   reservoir.  The new wells also generated upgrading of water<br>
   treatment plant controls and the installation of a new<br>
   distribution pump.  Maxim provided design plans and <br>
   specifications, received construction tenders, reviewed and<br>
   recommended for contract award and provided construction <br>
   inspection and contract administration.<br>

3. RESERVOIR REHABILITATION<br>
   TOWN OF EDSON<br>
<br>
   Maxim carried out site investigation work and prepared a <br>
   detailed feasibility study report for upgrading the five<br>
   potable water reservoirs for the Town of Edson.  These<br>
   reservoirs structures included an elevated steel tower<br>
   and tank (100 ft - 50,000 imperial gallon capacity), two<br>
   underground  tanks, one above ground concrete<br>
   tank (75 ft diameter x 30 ft high), and one above ground steel<br>
   tank (60 ft diameter x 30 ft high).  Only minor upgrading was <br>
   recommended for the concrete structures.  The steel reservoirs<br>
   however were in need or significant rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
   Following acceptance of our recommendations, Maxim was <br>
   commissioned to prepare the necessary design, to tender the<br>
   project, and to provide construction inspection and project<br>
   management services.  Remedial work included installation of <br>
   new foundation systems, sandblasting of steel, installation of <br>
   new fibreglass and epoxy liners, and new insulation for <br>
   exterior surfaces.<br>

   Maxim was commissioned to study the potable water production <br>
   facilities located on Camp Wainwright to determine how to <br>
   automate the system to enable production hours to be expanded<br>
   from 12 to 24 hours while reducing required operating hours <br>
   from 12 to eight.<br>
<br>
   The existing system includes a river intake pumping station <br>
   which pumps raw water to a large raw water storage reservoir <br>
   (lake).  A conventional 1.5 MGD water treatment plant treats<br>
   raw water from the lake using clarification and filtration, <br>
   and then pumps the potable water to an underground storage<br>
   reservoir.  Booster pumps deliver the water, through metering<br>
   stations which monitor the flows, from the underground storage<br>
   to elevated storage reservoirs at the Town of Wainwright and <br>
   at Camp Central.<br>
<br>
   The water treatment plant had a programmable logic controller <br>
   (PLC) in which the automatic mode had not reliably operated<br>
   since installation.  A telemetry system used several terminal <br>
   units (RTU&#39;s) to link all the facilities to the water <br>
   treatment plant, except for the river pumping station which<br>
   is independently operated.  The RTU&#39;s did not operate   <br>
   reliably.<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel visited the site several times to collect <br>
   data, receive input from system operating personnel and <br>
   camp engineers, and share ideas.  As a result, Maxim personnel<br>
   gained a comprehensive understanding of the system and the <br>
   client&#39;s goals.  From this, a simple clear report was written<br>
   which identified the required changes to the existing control <br>
   and telemetry system, and to areas of the process in order to <br>
   automate the plant.<br>
<br>
   Changes to the control system included upgrading and <br>
   re-programming the PLC to provide automatic operation,<br>
   installing a user friendly computerized Man Machine Interface<br>
   (MMI) to assist operators to control, track and manage the <br>
   system, installing new reliable RTU&#39;s to relay information    <br>
   from all the remote facilities over existing telephone lines<br>
   to the PLC and the MMI.  Changes to the process included <br>
   installing new pumps, valves, and instrumentation to support<br>
   24 hour operation.<br>
<br>
   The report was well received and implementation of the <br>
   recommendations was completed.<br>

1. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment lagoon expansion.  <br>
   The project was constructed during the summer of 1993.  The<br>
   lagoon expansion included construction of a new aerated <br>
   complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system in the <br>
   existing facultative cells, new blower/motor installation and <br>
   new manhole/control structures including all associated piping<br>
   and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide <br>
   mixing and oxygen entertainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.  An additional 192 new static <br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals<br>
   for construction.<br>

2. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank <br>
   and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to do <br>
   a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential sewerage and <br>
   sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries of St. Kitts &amp; <br>
   Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent &amp; <br>
   the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was to identify <br>
   priority projects in each of the countries and to develop a <br>
   framework by which international lending agencies can assess  <br>
   the feasibility of financing these projects.  The final report <br>
   also outlined what each country has to do in order to <br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope includes the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal<br>
     of sewage.  This included preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation <br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to<br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and <br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
   <br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy <br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing<br>
     countries, household income and preferences govern whether<br>
     a community wants and can afford to implement any type of <br>
     a sewage system.<br>
<br>
     The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
     was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

3. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City <br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
     system;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
The decanting system improvements have been implemented, the <br>
sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and commissioned, the <br>
existing pipelines have been externally investigated and one <br>
section has had the internal investigation completed, and the <br>
pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline are were completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility has been approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. has been <br>
included into the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline doubled the estimated total project <br>
cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.  The project was tendered <br>
and construction management provided by Maxim.<br>

4. SUMMER VILLAGES OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the<br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy<br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, 35 <br>
   km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird<br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon <br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

   MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter <br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the <br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed <br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to<br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

1. EAST WAINWRIGHT SUBDIVISION<br>
<br>
   In 1990 Maxim was retained by the Town of Wainwright, Alberta<br>
   to provide engineering design services for a new subdivision. <br>
   The project began with a servicing study for a proposed 180 <br>
   hectare residential and commercial development at the east end<br>
   of the Town.  The study involved a detailed analysis of the <br>
   existing water supply, sanitary sewer, and storm water <br>
   drainage systems to determine their capacity to accommodate<br>
   post development demands.<br>
<br>
   Storm water management was a particularly high priority in the<br>
   servicing study.  Development of the new subdivision would <br>
   increase the rate of runoff to two of the Town&#39;s storm <br>
   drainage systems.  One was already overloaded; therefore a    <br>
   parallel storm sewer was designed to raise the system&#39;s level<br>
   of service to an acceptable standard.  The other system would <br>
   carry runoff from most of the proposed development, and would<br>
   be affected significantly by the increased rate of runoff.  <br>
   Two storm water detention ponds were included in the storm<br>
   system design of the new subdivision, to reduce the rate of <br>
   outflow to the existing system to a manageable level.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to the servicing study, Maxim performed the<br>
   detailed design of underground services, drainage systems,<br>
   and road work for the first four phases of the new <br>
   development.  They include approximately 150 residential lots<br>
   as well as commercial property.<br>

3. WHITEMUD DRIVE DRAINAGE DESIGN<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were retained by the City of Edmonton  to <br>
   design the storm water drainage system for Whitemud Drive<br>
   between 99 Street and 106 Street.  The design required the use<br>
   of the Storm Water Management Model SWMM3 and a detailed <br>
   analysis of the drainage pattern of the land within and<br>
   adjacent to the proposed freeway, to determine the potential<br>
   volume and rate of runoff which could flow into the depressed <br>
   Whitemud freeway.  Due to limited excess capacity in the <br>
   existing storm sewer system, a 10,300 m cubed underground    <br>
   storage vault was designed to retain excess runoff.<br>
<br>
   The storage vault is located beneath the roadway, and consists <br>
   of a flat plate roof system, interior columns, and a raft type<br>
   foundation system.  Construction was carried out in six <br>
   different &quot;segments&quot;, producing a storage reservoir <br>
   approximately 44 m x 66 m x 5 m high.  Construction involved <br>
   over 3700 m cubed of cast-in-place concrete, and approximately<br>
   300,000 kg of epoxy coated and normal reinforcing steel.  <br>
   Interior and exterior waterproofing was also provided.<br>
<br>
   A &quot;hydrovex&quot; flow restriction device and a gate valve system<br>
   were included in the design to control the rate of outflow to<br>
   the existing storm sewer after the storm has subsided.  The<br>
   depth of the existing receiving sewer necessitated the design<br>
   and construction of three new &quot;drop manholes&quot;.  Water <br>
   entering each manhole plunges down to 20 m through a drop    <br>
   shaft into a lower chamber.  The lower chamber has a    <br>
   cast-in-place wall whose height and position are specially    <br>
   designed to reduce the kinetic energy of the storm water prior <br>
   to entering the receiving sewer.  Construction of the drainage <br>
   system was completed in late 1993.<br>

4. CITY OF EDMONTON - MILL WOODS DRAINAGE STUDY<br>
<br>
   The City of Edmonton, Environmental Services Department, <br>
   commissioned Maxim personnel to investigate and make<br>
   recommendations which would rectify basement flooding in<br>
   the Greenview subdivision of Mill Woods.  The study required<br>
   the review of street drainage and ponding, cross filtration<br>
   between storm and sanitary sewers, determination of ground<br>
   water infiltration and infiltration through foundation weeping<br>
   tile.  The alternative solutions included the installation of<br>
   an additional pipe system, surface or underground storage <br>
   and/or elimination of infiltration at the source.  The initial<br>
   report documented the frequency and volume of extraneous flow<br>
   resulting from rainfall, presented alternative remedial<br>
   measures.<br>
<br>
   A second phase included the installation of basement sump <br>
   pumps in existing homes which interrupted weeping tile flow<br>
   for discharge to the ground surface outside the home.  Our<br>
   program included data recorders and telemetry systems for <br>
   remote retrieval of sump pump operating records, and <br>
   installation of sewage flow and level recorders.  The analysis<br>
   of data utilized the Storm Water Management Model program to <br>
   simulate the sewer system flow conditions.  It was calibrated <br>
   to previous storm events, and used to estimate hydraulic grade<br>
   lines for future design storm events.  The result of data <br>
   analysis was that storage of extraneous flows was a more <br>
   efficient solution in Greenview than intercepting flows with<br>
   sump pumps.<br>

5. 153 AVENUE DRAINAGE DESIGN<br>
<br>
   The City of Edmonton Works Department, retained Maxim to <br>
   design the stormwater drainage system for a 1.5 kilometre<br>
   section of 153 Avenue between Fort Road and 18 Street.  The<br>
   new roadway intersected two natural drainage basins; thus<br>
   both overland and roadway drainage had to be accommodated.<br>
   Overland stormwater flows to had to be limited to <br>
   pre-development levels, and surface storage was incorporated<br>
   to meet this objective.  A 10,000 m cubed stormwater retention<br>
   pond was designed to intercept both natural and roadway <br>
   overland flow for release to the roadway piped system<br>
   following storm dissipation.  This facility included full<br>
   flow control complete with telemetry tied to the receiving<br>
   stormwater trunk sewer flows.<br>
<br>
   Roadway drainage to the 1:10 year storm event level was dealt<br>
   with by means of a piped conveyance system.  This system<br>
   included all required catchbains, catchbasin manholes, <br>
   manholes and storm sewer piping necessary to tie into an <br>
   existing storm sewer trunk.  The 11 m depth of the trunk<br>
   required design of a drop manhole and energy dissipater in <br>
   order to limit sewer drainage caused by high velocity flows.<br>
   A flow control orifice was incorporated into the piped system<br>
   to accommodate limited capacity in the receiving stormwater<br>
   trunk.<br>
<br>
   The project currently in the final design stage.<br>

1. GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA<br>
   WATER PUMPING STATIONS/FACILITIES REHABILITATION<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by Guyana Water <br>
   Authority (GUYWA) to prepare preliminary rehabilitation<br>
   designs for thirty-five (35) water pumping stations/facilities <br>
   and detailed designs including preparation of bidding <br>
   documents for ten (10) pumping stations/facilities as part of<br>
   the World Bank funded Water Supply Technical Assistance and<br>
   Rehabilitation Project.  The programme objective with respect <br>
   to pumping stations/facilities is rehabilitation of existing <br>
   systems that have fallen into various states of disrepair over<br>
   a number of years as a direct result of insufficient <br>
   maintenance.<br>
<br>
   During the initial conditions inspections in late March, 1993, <br>
   it became apparent that a number of the 35 stations that had <br>
   been selected by GUYWA for pre-design were interconnected to <br>
   adjacent pumping stations/facilities.  The extent of the <br>
   interconnections was confirmed in June when it was determined<br>
   that the original list of 35 stations impacted on a total of <br>
   86 facilities.<br>
<br>
   The presence of extensive interconnected systems meant that <br>
   the World Bank&#39;s original programme strategy to rehabilitate<br>
   individual pumping stations/facilities was no longer cost <br>
   effective.  Maxim Engineering Inc. developed a new approach <br>
   focusing on rehabilitation of interconnected systems with an<br>
   emphasis on reducing the overall number of pumping stations <br>
   and associated operating and maintenance costs.<br>
<br>
   Maxim finalized the pre-design reports for 7 major water <br>
   supply/treatment rehabilitation schemes (including complete   <br>
   distribution system reconstruction) servicing a total <br>
   population of 160,000.  We subsequently finalized detailed<br>
   rehabilitation designs and bidding documents for 6 water <br>
   treatment plants, 4 elevated storage towers, 27 water pumping<br>
   stations and associated interconnecting transmission mains for<br>
   the 7 systems.<br>
<br>
   In addition, Maxim was commissioned to conduct a site <br>
   evaluation of the existing Water Treatment Plant at Bartica<br>
   on the west bank of the Essiquibo River.  We were then <br>
   authorized to prepare a pre-design study, tender documents and <br>
   specifications for complete rehabilitation of the water <br>
   treatment plant.<br>

2. TOWN OF MILLET<br>
   WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION STUDY<br>
<br>
   The Town of Millet, with a population of 2,000, uses a       <br>
   water distribution network supplied by a central reservoir<br>
   which in turn is supplied by ground water wells.  A barely<br>
   sufficient water supply capacity and low system pressures<br>
   warranted an overall Water Supply and Distribution Study.<br>
<br>
   Data was collected and reviewed to assess the existing water <br>
   supply capacity.  Future Town populations were then projected<br>
   to identify future water supply needs.  The distribution <br>
   system was modelled utilizing the &quot;WATER&quot; computer program <br>
   and later calibrated using flow and system pressure data <br>
   collected in the field.  The calibrated model was used to <br>
   identify system modifications required to boost system <br>
   pressures now and in the future and to stimulate future <br>
   expansion of the distribution system.  Recommendations for<br>
   phased construction of system and supply modifications were<br>
   submitted in report form.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to submission of our report, the Town commissioned<br>
   Maxim to retain a groundwater hydrologist to identify and <br>
   complete a suitable additional well water supply and <br>
   authorized Maxim to connect the wells to the existing <br>
   reservoir.  The new walls also generated upgrading of water<br>
   treatment plant controls and the installation of a new<br>
   distribution pump.  Maxim provided design plans and <br>
   specifications, received construction tenders, reviewed and<br>
   recommended for contract award and provided construction <br>
   inspection and contract administration.<br>

3. RESERVOIR REHABILITATION<br>
   TOWN OF EDSON<br>
<br>
   Maxim carried out site investigation work and prepared a <br>
   detailed feasibility study report for upgrading the five<br>
   potable water reservoirs for the Town of Edson.  These<br>
   reservoirs structures included an elevated steel tower<br>
   and tank (100 ft - 50,000 imperial gallon capacity), two<br>
   underground concrete tanks, one above ground concrete<br>
   tank (75 ft diameter x 30 ft high), and one above ground steel<br>
   tank (60 ft diameter x 30 ft high).  Only minor upgrading was <br>
   recommended for the concrete structures.  The steel reservoirs<br>
   however were in need or significant rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
   Following acceptance of our recommendations, Maxim was <br>
   commissioned to prepare the necessary design, to tender the<br>
   project, and to provide construction inspection and project<br>
   management services.  Remedial work included installation of <br>
   new foundation systems, sandblasting of steel, installation of <br>
   new fibreglass and epoxy liners, and new insulation for <br>
   exterior surfaces.<br>

4. CAMP WAINWRIGHT<br>
   WATER PRODUCTION SYSTEM AUTOMATION STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim was commissioned to study the potable water production <br>
   facilities located on Camp Wainwright to determine how to <br>
   automate the system to enable production hours to be expanded<br>
   from 12 to 24 hours while reducing required operating hours <br>
   from 12 to eight.<br>
<br>
   The existing system includes a river intake pumping station <br>
   which pumps raw water to a large raw water storage reservoir <br>
   (lake).  A conventional 1.5 MGD water treatment plant treats<br>
   raw water from the lake using clarification and filtration, <br>
   and then pumps the potable water to an underground storage<br>
   reservoir.  Booster pumps deliver the water, through metering<br>
   stations which monitor the flows, from the underground storage<br>
   to elevated storage reservoirs at the Town of Wainwright and <br>
   at Camp Central.<br>
<br>
   The water treatment plant has a programmable logic controller <br>
   (PLC) in which the automatic mode has not reliably operated<br>
   since installation.  A telemetry system uses several terminal <br>
   units (RTU&#39;s) to link all the facilities to the water <br>
   treatment plant, except for the river pumping station which<br>
   is independently operated.  The RTU&#39;s do not operate   <br>
   reliably.<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel visited the site several times to collect <br>
   data, receive input from system operating personnel and <br>
   camp engineers, and share ideas.  As a result, Maxim personnel<br>
   gained a comprehensive understanding of the system and the <br>
   client&#39;s goals.  From this, a simply clear report was written<br>
   which identified the required changes to the existing control <br>
   and telemetry system, and to areas of the process in order to <br>
   automate the plant.<br>
<br>
   Changes to the control system included upgrading and <br>
   re-programming the PLC to provide automatic operation,<br>
   installing a user friendly computerized Man Machine Interface<br>
   (MMI) to assist operators to control, track and manage the <br>
   system, installing new reliable RTU&#39;s to relay information    <br>
   from all the remote facilities over existing telephone lines<br>
   to the PLC and the MMI.  Changes to the process included <br>
   installing new pumps, valves, and instrumentation to support<br>
   24 hour operation.<br>
<br>
   The report was implemented and the construction is now <br>
   complete.<br>

BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil drill <br>
pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other oilfield <br>
wastes will require proceeding and in most cases, disposal in an <br>
environmentally acceptable manner.  The most efficient and cost <br>
effective, yet environmentally sound manner of disposal for this <br>
oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a Class 1 a Industrial <br>
landfill.<br>
<br>
Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for the <br>
proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of hydrologists, <br>
geologists, environmentalists, landscape architects, biologists <br>
and public relations sub-consultants.  Maxim&#39;s team completed the <br>
Public Disclosure and Public Information phase of the project in <br>
December 1996 and submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment <br>
and conceptual design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
Currently Maxim is preparing the detail design and application <br>
for Alberta Environmental approval.  The landfill if scheduled <br>
for construction during the second half of 1998.<br>

1. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment lagoon expansion.  <br>
   The project was constructed during the summer of 1993.  The<br>
   lagoon expansion included construction of a new aerated <br>
   complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system in the <br>
   existing facultative cells, new blower/motor installation and <br>
   new manhole/control structures including all associated piping<br>
   and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide <br>
   mixing and oxygen entertainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.  An additional 192 new static <br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals<br>
   for construction.<br>

2. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and   <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential    <br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries  <br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, <br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was  <br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies   <br>
   could assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report would also outline what each country has to do in <br>
   order to implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope includes the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal<br>
     of sewage.  This included preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation <br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to<br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and <br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
   <br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy <br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing<br>
     countries, household income and preferences govern whether<br>
     a community wants and can afford to implement any type of <br>
     a sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

3. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City <br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
     system;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
The decanting system improvements have been implemented, the <br>
sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and the pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline have <br>
been completed.  <br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility has been approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. has been <br>
included into the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.  The project was <br>
designed, tendered and construction management provided by Maxim.<br>

4. SUMMER VILLAGES OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the<br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy<br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, 35 <br>
   km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird<br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon <br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

   MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter <br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the <br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed <br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to<br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

1. GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA<br>
   WATER PUMPING STATIONS/FACILITIES REHABILITATION<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by Guyana Water <br>
   Authority (GUYWA) to prepare preliminary rehabilitation<br>
   designs for thirty-five (35) water pumping stations/facilities <br>
   and detailed designs including preparation of bidding <br>
   documents for ten (10) pumping stations/facilities as part of<br>
   the World Bank funded Water Supply Technical Assistance and<br>
   Rehabilitation Project.  The programme objective with respect <br>
   to pumping stations/facilities is rehabilitation of existing <br>
   systems that have fallen into various states of disrepair over<br>
   a number of years as a direct result of insufficient <br>
   maintenance.<br>
<br>
   During the initial conditions inspections in late March, 1993, <br>
   it became apparent that a number of the 35 stations that had <br>
   been selected by GUYWA for pre-design were interconnected to <br>
   adjacent pumping stations/facilities.  The extent of the <br>
   interconnections was confirmed in June when it was determined<br>
   that the original list of 35 stations impacted on a total of <br>
   86 facilities.<br>
<br>
   The presence of extensive interconnected systems meant that <br>
   the World Bank&#39;s original programme strategy to rehabilitate<br>
   individual pumping stations/facilities was no longer cost <br>
   effective.  Maxim Engineering Inc. developed a new approach <br>
   focusing on rehabilitation of interconnected systems with an<br>
   emphasis on reducing the overall number of pumping stations <br>
   and associated operating and maintenance costs.<br>
<br>
   Maxim finalized the pre-design reports for 7 major water <br>
   supply/treatment rehabilitation schemes (including complete   <br>
   distribution system reconstruction) servicing a total <br>
   population of 160,000.  We subsequently finalized detailed<br>
   rehabilitation designs and bidding documents for 6 water <br>
   treatment plants, 4 elevated storage towers, 27 water pumping<br>
   stations and associated interconnecting transmission mains for<br>
   the 7 systems.<br>
<br>
   In addition, Maxim was commissioned to conduct a site <br>
   evaluation of the existing Water Treatment Plant at Bartica<br>
   on the west bank of the Essiquibo River.  We were then <br>
   authorized to prepare a pre-design study, tender documents and <br>
   specifications for complete rehabilitation of the water <br>
   treatment plant.<br>

   WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION STUDY<br>
<br>
   The Town of Millet, with a population of 2,000, uses a       <br>
   water distribution network supplied by a central reservoir<br>
   which in turn is supplied by ground water wells.  A barely<br>
   sufficient water supply capacity and low system pressures<br>
   warranted an overall Water Supply and Distribution Study.<br>
<br>
   Data was collected and reviewed to assess the existing water <br>
   supply capacity.  Future Town populations were then projected<br>
   to identify future water supply needs.  The distribution <br>
   system was modelled utilizing the &quot;WATER&quot; computer program <br>
   and later calibrated using flow and system pressure data <br>
   collected in the field.  The calibrated model was used to <br>
   identify system modifications required to boost system <br>
   pressures now and in the future and to stimulate future <br>
   expansion of the distribution system.  Recommendations for<br>
   phased construction of system and supply modifications were<br>
   submitted in report form.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to submission of our report, the Town commissioned<br>
   Maxim to retain a groundwater hydrologist to identify and <br>
   complete a suitable additional well water supply and <br>
   authorized Maxim to connect the wells to the existing <br>
   reservoir.  The new walls also generated upgrading of water<br>
   treatment plant controls and the installation of a new<br>
   distribution pump.  Maxim provided design plans and <br>
   specifications, received construction tenders, reviewed and<br>
   recommended for contract award and provided construction <br>
   inspection and contract administration.<br>

3. RESERVOIR REHABILITATION<br>
   TOWN OF EDSON<br>
<br>
   Maxim carried out site investigation work and prepared a <br>
   detailed feasibility study report for upgrading the five<br>
   potable water reservoirs for the Town of Edson.  These<br>
   reservoirs structures included an elevated steel tower<br>
   and tank (100 ft - 50,000 imperial gallon capacity), two<br>
   underground concrete tanks, one above ground concrete<br>
   tank (75 ft diameter x 30 ft high), and one above ground steel<br>
   tank (60 ft diameter x 30 ft high).  Only minor upgrading was <br>
   recommended for the concrete structures.  The steel reservoirs<br>
   however were in need or significant rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
   Following acceptance of our recommendations, Maxim was <br>
   commissioned to prepare the necessary design, to tender the<br>
   project, and to provide construction inspection and project<br>
   management services.  Remedial work included installation of <br>
   new foundation systems, sandblasting of steel, installation of <br>
   new fibreglass and epoxy liners, and new insulation for <br>
   exterior surfaces.<br>

4. CAMP WAINWRIGHT<br>
   WATER PRODUCTION SYSTEM AUTOMATION STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim was commissioned to study the potable water production <br>
   facilities located on Camp Wainwright to determine how to <br>
   automate the system to enable production hours to be expanded<br>
   from 12 to 24 hours while reducing required operating hours <br>
   from 12 to eight.<br>
<br>
   The existing system includes a river intake pumping station <br>
   which pumps raw water to a large raw water storage reservoir <br>
   (lake).  A conventional 1.5 MGD water treatment plant treats<br>
   raw water from the lake using clarification and filtration, <br>
   and then pumps the potable water to an underground storage<br>
   reservoir.  Booster pumps deliver the water, through metering<br>
   stations which monitor the flows, from the underground storage<br>
   to elevated storage reservoirs at the Town of Wainwright and <br>
   at Camp Central.<br>
<br>
   The water treatment plant had a programmable logic controller <br>
   (PLC) in which the automatic mode was not reliably operated<br>
   since installation.  A telemetry system used several terminal <br>
   units (RTU&#39;s) to link all the facilities to the water <br>
   treatment plant, except for the river pumping station which<br>
   is independently operated.  The RTU&#39;s did not operate   <br>
   reliably.<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel visited the site several times to collect <br>
   data, receive input from system operating personnel and <br>
   camp engineers, and share ideas.  As a result, Maxim personnel<br>
   gained a comprehensive understanding of the system and the <br>
   client&#39;s goals.  From this, a simple clear report was written<br>
   which identified the required changes to the existing control <br>
   and telemetry system, and to areas of the process in order to <br>
   automate the plant.<br>
<br>
   Changes to the control system included upgrading and <br>
   re-programming the PLC to provide automatic operation,<br>
   installing a user friendly computerized Man Machine Interface<br>
   (MMI) to assist operators to control, track and manage the <br>
   system, installing new reliable RTU&#39;s to relay information    <br>
   from all the remote facilities over existing telephone lines<br>
   to the PLC and the MMI.  Changes to the process included <br>
   installing new pumps, valves, and instrumentation to support<br>
   24 hour operation.<br>
<br>
   The report was and implemented and the construction is <br>
   complete.<br>

systems, highways, grade separation structures and traffic <br>
interchanges.  In addition, we have performed rehabilitation <br>
studies, and ratings for municipal road systems.  Our staff <br>
includes personnel with specialized experience in the design and <br>
construction of streets and highways.<br>
<br>
Typically projects include:<br>
<br>
1. ALBERTA TRANSPORTATION &amp; UTILITIES<br>
   LOG HAUL AND WEIGH-SCALE INTERSECTION DESIGN<br>
<br>
   As part of a functional planning and public consultation <br>
   assignment for Alberta Transportation &amp; Utilities, Maxim <br>
   Engineering designed an intersection at the intersection<br>
   of a secondary and a primary highway at Drayton Valley that <br>
   included provision for turning logging trucks and access to a <br>
   self-weigh scale site.<br>

2. TOWN OF MILLET - STREET REHABILITATION PROGRAM<br>
<br>
   In 1994 Maxim Engineering Inc. prepared a feasibility study <br>
   and cost estimate for the Town streets rehabilitation program.<br>
   The Town&#39;s intent was to utilize the        <br>
   Federal/Provincial/Municipal infrastructure program to upgrade<br>
   from their existing gravel and cold mix asphalt streets to a <br>
   hot mix asphalt road surface with new curbs and walks.  Maxim<br>
   staff worked within the Town&#39;s budget to design the drainage <br>
   and road systems, tendered the project and supervised <br>
   construction during 1994.  The construction project required <br>
   stripping and re-use of cold mix aggregate for fill <br>
   replacement of unsuitable subgrade material, removal of <br>
   unsuitable sidewalks, replacement of curbs, gutters and <br>
   walkways, installation of new curbs and gutters,   <br>
   installation of geotextile mat to stabilize poor subgrade soil<br>
   conditions, and coordinating existing irregular lot grades. <br>

   HIGHWAY 14 PAVEMENT REHABILITATION<br>
   AND HIGHWAY 21 WIDENING<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering is currently completing the design phase of <br>
   a project that consists of pavement rehabilitation of Highway <br>
   14 from South of Cooking Lake to South of Lindbrook and the <br>
   widening of Highway 21 for 2.4 km South from the junction with<br>
   Secondary Highway 623.  The scope of work includes design, <br>
   right-of-way acquisition, contract tendering and <br>
   administration, and construction supervision for 10.78 km of <br>
   pavement rehabilitation and intersectional treatment and <br>
   construction of a new passing lane near New Sarepta.  The <br>
   terms of reference include Managed Quality Assurance Testing.<br>

4. ALBERTA TRANSPORTATION &amp; UTILITIES<br>
<br>
   A current project that Maxim has for Alberta Transportation &amp; <br>
   Utilities is the 1997 Seal Coat Program for their <br>
   North-Central Region (Barrhead).<br>
<br>
   The project consists of the application of over 700,000 square <br>
   metres of seal coat along seven sections of primary highway <br>
   and six bridge structures.  Included, for the first time in<br>
   any seal coat contract, is a provision for the repair of all <br>
   minor surface defects, including pothole patching.  When <br>
   completed, this project will have involved over 190 <br>
   lane-kilometres of highway ranging from border-to-border in <br>
   North-Central Alberta.<br>

                            During the past 5 years Morrison Hershfield Limited engineers <br>
and technologists have assisted the forest industry with site <br>
development including log yards, gantry crane runways &amp; <br>
installation, drainage, lumber yards and forestry roadways.<br>
<br>
Typically projects have included:<br>
<br>
1. TOLKO INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
   HIGH PRAIRIE OSB MILL<br>
   LOG YARD AND GANTRY CRANE TRACKAGE<br>
<br>
   Tolko Industries Ltd. of Vernon, British Columbia was <br>
   awarded the timber rights for the High Prairie Timber <br>
   Development Area.  As a result, Tolko has built a 450 million<br>
   square foot (3/8&quot; basis) Oriented Strand Board (OSB) Mill at <br>
   High Prairie, Alberta.<br>
<br>
   To handle the raw logs in the wood yard it was decided to <br>
   install a portal gantry crane which has a 205 foot span,<br>
   85 foot cantilevers and lifts 30 tons.  The supply of the <br>
   crane, log yard development and crane trackage was awarded to <br>
   Kone Wood.  Morrison Hershfield Limited sub-contracted by <br>
Kone Wood to engineer, design &amp; construct the log yard and crane <br>
trackage.<br>
<br>
   Detail engineering was carried out with the results that the <br>
   project&#39;s final configuration involved moving 120,000 Cu.Yd. <br>
   of gravel placement, 6,000 lin. feet of sub-drains, drainage <br>
   ditches, culverts, lift stations, 500 feet of reinforced earth<br>
   retaining wall, 1,500 feet of gantry crane trackage, concrete <br>
   pavement and safety barriers, and miscellaneous structures.<br>
<br>
   A project of this nature required the involvement of a <br>
   multi-discipline engineering and contracting approach and the <br>
   team that Morrison Hershfield Limited assembled involved a <br>
full range of heavy civil engineering and construction firms.  <br>
<br>
After three years of operations, a forest fire Northwest of the <br>
Tolko High Prairie OSB Mill spread to the log yard destroying <br>
the log inventory and the gantry crane.  Morrison Hershfield <br>
Limited was then commissioned immediately to provide cost <br>
estimates and plans for replacing the crane.<br>
<br>
Once the immediate needs had been met, the destruction of the <br>
log handling equipment afforded Tolko with the opportunity to <br>
reassess the use of a gantry crane vs conventional mobile <br>
equipment.  Working very closely with Tolko personnel, Morrison <br>
Hershfield Limited carried out a study on available log handling <br>
systems.  The written report, which resulted from the study, was <br>
presented to the Owners of Tolko who then made the final <br>
decision on the log handling system.<br>
<br>
2. ZEIDLER FOREST INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
   LOG YARD DEVELOPMENT<br>
<br>
   Morrison Hershfield Limited has been commissioned by Zeidler <br>
to carry out a study on the log handling systems available and to<br>
   determine which system would be best for Zeidler&#39;s Slave Lake <br>
   Veneer Mill and Sawmill.<br>
<br>
   In addition to the log yard, also included in the review was <br>
   the use and upgrading of the lumber yards, peeler handing    <br>
   area, plant roads and travelling area.  Alternative yard <br>
   layouts were developed, cost estimates prepared, advantages<br>
   and disadvantages reported.<br>
<br>
3. VANDERWELL&#39;S MITSUE SAWMILL<br>
   SITE DEVELOPMENT<br>
<br>
   PHASE 1 - LOG YARD AND GANTRY CRANE TRACKAGE<br>
<br>
   For a number of years the operation at Vanderwell&#39;s Mitsue <br>
   Sawmill has been hindered by very poor site conditions for <br>
   storing and moving logs to the sawmill.  This resulted in <br>
   Vanderwell ordering a gantry crane for the handling of logs.<br>
   Vanderwell then commissioned Morrison Hershfield to review<br>
   alternatives and prepare a conceptual design for the gantry<br>
   crane trackage, overall log yard and general site <br>
   improvements.  Once these alternatives were presented and <br>
   Vanderwell chose the best alternatives for their position, <br>
   Morrison Hershfield Limited then proceeded with the detailed <br>
design, assisted with ordering materials, and managed the <br>
construction of the facilities.<br>
<br>
   PHASE 2 - LUMBER YARD PAVEMENT<br>
<br>
   During the winter of 1998, a gravel source was obtained and a <br>
   crushing contract let to prepare 150,000 tonnes of aggregate<br>
   for the paving of the lumber handling areas of the sawmill <br>
   site.  During June and July, the earthworks were carried out<br>
   preparing the site for roller compacted concrete surfacing<br>
   of the lumber handling area.<br>
<br>
   The roller compacted contract has been awarded and 82,000 m <br>
   sq. of roller compacted concrete will be placed in August, <br>
   1998.  <br>
<br>
   This will complete the re-development of the sawmill site <br>
   over a two year period totalling approximately $7,500,000.<br>

1. TOWN OF WAINWRIGHT<br>
   MUNICIPAL ENGINEERING SERVICES<br>
<br>
From 1990 through 2001, Morrison Hershfield has provided full <br>
engineering services for the Town of Wainwright.  These projects <br>
have included approximately 150 lots for single family housing, <br>
multiple family complexes, mobile home subdivisions and <br>
apartment buildings as well as the upgrading of its sewage <br>
treatment facilities.  This sewage treatment-upgrading project <br>
included construction of a new aerated complete mix cell, <br>
replacement of the aeration system in the existing cells and <br>
installation of a new blower/motor and new manhole/control <br>
structures associated with piping and sewers.  Construction of <br>
this project was completed during the summer of 1993.<br>
In addition to these civil engineering assignments, Morrison <br>
Hershfield has provided building engineering services, including <br>
electrical, instrumentation and mechanical engineering for a <br>
retrofit of the firehall.  Mechanical, electrical and <br>
instrumentation engineering services were also provided for <br>
upgrading of the control and telemetry system for the Wainwright <br>
Regional Water Treatment Plant, which is located at the Canadian <br>
Forces Base Wainwright.<br>
In 1998-99 Morrison Hershfield provided design engineering for <br>
the approval and construction of a major stormwater drainage <br>
system which services the centre and business section of town.  <br>
The existing system was undersized and causing frequent flooding <br>
during the summer months.<br>
The new system, with a total length of 3000m, was comprised of <br>
three elements:  pipe, ditching and two stormwater detention <br>
ponds.  Because of limited clearances with existing utilities, <br>
round and arch CMP pipe was used, ranging in size from 750 mm to <br>
1790 X 1360 arch. <br>
Currently, MH is carrying out a complete water network analysis <br>
having done a sanitary sewer system and stormwater drainage <br>
analysis over the last few years. Also at the present time, MH <br>
is designing two new subdivisions and an extension of servicing <br>
for a new institutional facility site.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
Morrison Hershfield Limited was contracted by the World Bank and <br>
the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to    <br>
complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential   <br>
sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries    <br>
of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,    <br>
St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was   <br>
to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to    <br>
develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The  <br>
final report included an outline of what each country has to<br>
do in order to implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
   <br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal<br>
     of sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity <br>
to   operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with <br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy for<br>
     identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability and <br>
     willingness to pay.  In the context of developing countries,<br>
     household income and preferences govern whether a community <br>
     wants and can afford to implement any type of a sewage <br>
     system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December 1996.<br>

2. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   Morrison Hershfield Limited was commissioned by the City  <br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling    <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance<br>
     system;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility has been approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. has been <br>
included into the project.  The composting facility impacted<br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project <br>
because sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL), must <br>
now be delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to <br>
CBL. <br>
<br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Morrison Hershfield  <br>
has worked closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate <br>
transporting sludge and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and <br>
to meet the operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements <br>
to the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing <br>
and the mutual economic benefits to the City of Celanese. <br>
<br>
Inclusion of this second new pipeline doubled the total project <br>
cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.  The project is now <br>
complete.<br>

1. GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA<br>
   WATER PUMPING STATIONS/FACILITIES REHABILITATION<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by Guyana Water <br>
   Authority (GUYWA) to prepare preliminary rehabilitation<br>
   designs for thirty-five (35) water pumping stations/facilities <br>
   and detailed designs including preparation of bidding <br>
   documents for ten (10) pumping stations/facilities as part of<br>
   the World Bank funded Water Supply Technical Assistance and <br>
   Rehabilitation Project.  The programme objective with respect <br>
   to pumping stations/facilities is rehabilitation of exisiting <br>
   systems that have fallen into various states of disrepair over<br>
   a number of years as a direct result of insufficient <br>
   maintenance.<br>
<br>
   During the initial conditions inspections in late March, 1993, <br>
   it became apparent that a number of the 35 stations that had <br>
   been selected by GUYWA for pre-design were interconnected to <br>
   adjacent pumping stations/facilities.  The extent of the <br>
   interconnections was confirmed in June when it was determined<br>
   that the original list of 35 stations impacted on a total of <br>
   86 facilities.<br>
<br>
   The presence of extensive interconnected systems meant that <br>
   the World Bank&#39;s original programme strategy to rehabilitate<br>
   individual pumping stations/facilities was no longer cost <br>
   effective.  Maxim Engineering Inc. developed a new approach <br>
   focusing on rehabilitation of interconnected systems with an<br>
   emphasis on reducing the overall number of pumping stations <br>
   and associated operating and maintenance costs.<br>
<br>
   Maxim finalized the pre-design reports for 7 major water <br>
   supply/treatment rehabilitation schemes (including complete   <br>
   distribution system reconstruction) servicing a total <br>
   population of 160,000.  We subsequently finalized detailed<br>
   rehabilitation designs and bidding documents for 6 water <br>
   treatment plants, 4 elevated storage towers, 27 water pumping<br>
   stations and associated interconnecting transmission mains for<br>
   the 7 systems.<br>
<br>
   In addition, Maxim was commissioned to conduct a site <br>
   evaluation of the existing Water Treatment Plant at Bartica<br>
   on the west bank of the Essiquibo River.  We were then <br>
   authorized to prepare a pre-design study, tender documents and <br>
   specifications for complete rehabilitation of the water <br>
   treatment plant.<br>

2. TOWN OF MILLET<br>
   WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION STUDY<br>
<br>
   The Town of Millet, with a population of 2,000, uses a       <br>
   water distribution network supplied by a central reservoir<br>
   which in turn is supplied by ground water wells.  A barely<br>
   sufficient water supply capacity and low system pressures<br>
   warranted an overall Water Supply and Distribution Study.<br>
<br>
   Data was collected and reviewed to assess the existing water <br>
   supply capacity.  Future Town populations were then projected<br>
   to identify future water supply needs.  The distribution <br>
   system was modelled utilizing the &quot;WATER&quot; computer program <br>
   and later calibrated using flow and system pressure data <br>
   collected in the field.  The calibrated model was used to <br>
   identify system modifications required to boost system <br>
   pressures now and in the future and to simulate future <br>
   expansion of the distribution system.  Recommendations for<br>
   phased construction of system and supply modifications were<br>
   submitted in report form.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to submission of our report, the Town commissioned<br>
   Maxim to retain a groundwater hydrologist to identify and <br>
   complete a suitable additional well water supply and <br>
   authorized Maxim to connect the wells to the existing <br>
   reservoir.  The new wells also generated upgrading of water<br>
   treatment plant controls and the installation of a new<br>
   distribution pump.  Maxim provided design plans and <br>
   specifications, received construction tenders, reviewed and<br>
   recommended for contract award and provided construction <br>
   inspection and contract administration.<br>

3. RESERVOIR REHABILITATION<br>
   TOWN OF EDSON<br>
<br>
   Maxim carried out site investigation work and prepared a <br>
   detailed feasibility study for upgrading the five potable     <br>
   water reservoirs for the Town of Edson.  These reservoir    <br>
   structures included an elevated steel tower and tank <br>
   (100 ft - 50,000 imperial gallon capacity), two underground   <br>
   concrete tanks, one above ground concrete tank <br>
   (75 ft diameter x 30 ft high), and one above ground steel<br>
   tank (60 ft diameter x 30 ft high).  Only minor upgrading was <br>
   recommended for the concrete structures.  The steel reservoirs<br>
   however were in need of significant rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
   Following acceptance of our recommendations, Maxim was <br>
   commissioned to prepare the necessary design, to tender the<br>
   project, and to provide construction inspection and project<br>
   management services.  Remedial work included installation of <br>
   new foundation systems, sandblasting of steel, installation of <br>
   new fibreglass and epoxy liners, and new insulation for <br>
   exterior surfaces.<br>

4. CAMP WAINWRIGHT (DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE)<br>
   WATER PRODUCTION SYSTEM AUTOMATION STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim was commissioned to study the potable water production <br>
   facilities located on Camp Wainwright to determine how to <br>
   automate the system to enable production hours to be expanded<br>
   from 12 to 24 hours while reducing required operating hours <br>
   from 12 to eight.<br>
<br>
   The existing system includes a river intake pumping station <br>
   which pumps raw water to a large raw water storage reservoir <br>
   (lake).  A conventional 1.5 MGD water treatment plant treats<br>
   raw water from the lake using clarification and filtration, <br>
   and then pumps the potable water to an underground storage<br>
   reservoir.  Booster pumps deliver the water, through metering<br>
   stations which monitor the flows, from the underground storage<br>
   to elevated storage reservoirs at the Town of Wainwright and <br>
   at Camp Central.<br>
<br>
   The water treatment plant has a programmable logic controller <br>
   (PLC) in which the automatic mode has not reliably operated<br>
   since installation.  A telemetry system uses several terminal <br>
   units (RTU&#39;s) to link all the facilities to the water <br>
   treatment plant, except for the river pumping station which<br>
   is independently operated.  The RTU&#39;s do not operate   <br>
   reliably.<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel visited the site several times to collect <br>
   data, receive input from system operating personnel and <br>
   camp engineers, and share ideas.  As a result, Maxim personnel<br>
   gained a comprehensive understanding of the system and the <br>
   client&#39;s goals.  From this, a simple clear report was written<br>
   which identified the required changes to the existing control <br>
   and telemetry system, and to areas of the process in order to <br>
   automate the plant.<br>
<br>
   Changes to the control system included upgrading and <br>
   re-programming the PLC to provide automatic operation,<br>
   installing a user friendly computerized Man Machine Interface<br>
   (MMI) to assist operators to control, track and manage the <br>
   system, installing new reliable RTU&#39;s to relay information    <br>
   from all the remote facilities over existing telephone lines<br>
   to the PLC and the MMI.  Changes to the process included <br>
   installing new pumps, valves, and instrumentation to support<br>
   24 hour operation.<br>
<br>
   The report was well received and implementation of the <br>
   recommendations was completed with Maxim providing general<br>
   engineering services during construction.<br>

1. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s aerated lagoon expansion.  The <br>
   project was constructed during the summer of 1993.  The<br>
   lagoon expansion included construction of a new aerated <br>
   complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system in the <br>
   existing facultative cells, new blower/motor installation and <br>
   new manhole/control structures including all associated piping<br>
   and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide <br>
   mixing and oxygen entrainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.  An additional 192 new static <br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals<br>
   for construction.<br>

2. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to    <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential    <br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries  <br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, <br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was  <br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies   <br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The  <br>
   final report included an outline of what each country has to  <br>
   do in order to implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal<br>
     of sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation <br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to<br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated      <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water<br>
     and Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
   <br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy <br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing<br>
     countries, household income and preferences govern whether<br>
     a community wants and can afford to implement any type of <br>
     a sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

3. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City <br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
     systsem;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility has been approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. has been <br>
included into the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual ecomomic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline doubled the total project cost from <br>
$2.5 million to $5 million.  The project is now completed.<br>

4. SUMMER VILLAGES OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the<br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy<br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, 35 <br>
   km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird<br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project inlcuded determination of design flows based upon <br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

   MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter <br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the <br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed <br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to<br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

identify remedial action  required to correct water infiltration <br>
problems for the parkade and recreational centre portions of the <br>
high-rise apartment/commercial building complex.  Following this <br>
study, Morrison Hershfield Limited prepared contract documents <br>
and provided construction supervision to implement <br>
recommendations.<br>
<br>
The scope of work included removal of all hard and soft <br>
landscaping around the perimeter of the building complex;<br>
installation of a new rubberized asphalt (double membrane)<br>
waterproofing system; reconstruction of sidewalks, planters,<br>
and fences; and installation of new sod and plant material as<br>
part of an upgraded landscape development plan.<br>
<br>
Structurally, the project also included re-roofing of the    <br>
plaza areas; reconstruction of masonry (brick) walls complete   <br>
with new flashing and building envelope systems; strengthening <br>
of interior precast beam bearing locations near one of the major <br>
expansion joints in the complex; and reconstruction of interior <br>
washroom and sauna facilities which were damaged from water <br>
infiltration.<br>
<br>
Work was carried out in two phases under two separate    <br>
contracts.  Both projects were completed ahead of schedule and <br>
under budget.<br>

<br>
Services Offered:<br>
<br>
    - Treatability Studies<br>
    - Pilot Plant Studies<br>
    - Resource Recovery Studies<br>
    - Chemical Analysis of Water Supplies and Wastewater<br>
    - Environmental Audits<br>
    - Environmental Site Assessments<br>
<br>
Typical projects are as follows:<br>
<br>
1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
The most efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound <br>
manner of disposal of oilfield/industrial waste is to develop a <br>
Class 1a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
During the spring and summer of 1996 Byram Industrial Services <br>
Ltd. (BISL) identified several possible sites and through a <br>
preliminary screening of geological characteristics identified a <br>
good site for a Class 1a Hazardous Waste Industrial Landfill.  <br>
After preliminary discussions with Alberta Environment (AEVN) <br>
and public meetings with local residents, a Project Disclosure <br>
Document was published and distributed to the general public, <br>
interested third parties and AEVN.  Under the Alberta <br>
Environmental Protection Act a Class 1a landfill is a mandatory <br>
activity that requires a full Environmental Impact Assessment <br>
(EIA) be carried out.  This EIA was carried out and submitted to <br>
AEVN in December 1997. <br>
<br>
Once the EIA was accepted as complete, the Application to <br>
Construct, Operate and Reclaim the landfill was prepared and <br>
submitted in July 1998. <br>
<br>
Throughout this process a Coalition of Environmental groups <br>
monitored the complete process and in October 1998 a specially <br>
prepared document addressing their specific concerns was <br>
prepared and submitted to these special interest groups.<br>
The approval for the construction of the landfill was obtained <br>
from AEVN on April 21, 1999 and construction of the facilities <br>
started in early May.  The construction took 5 months and the <br>
landfill went into operation in early September 1999.  The <br>
landfill consists of the following facilities on 300 hectares of <br>
land:<br>
Þ Access road<br>
Þ Scales, office and laboratory<br>
Þ Run-on and runoff drainage control<br>
Þ Monitoring wells, terrestrial sample plots, aquatic life <br>
sampling plots and monitoring facilities.<br>
Þ A 100 metre by 100 metre first disposal cell<br>
Þ The necessary support facilities<br>
The site has been conceptually approved for 32 similar sized <br>
cells and it is anticipated that it will have a life of twenty-<br>
five to thirty years.<br>
<br>
2. TOWN OF WAINWRIGHT<br>
   MUNICIPAL ENGINEERING SERVICES<br>
<br>
From 1990 through 2001, Morrison Hershfield has provided full <br>
engineering services for the Town of Wainwright.  These projects <br>
have included approximately 150 lots for single family housing, <br>
multiple family complexes, mobile home subdivisions and <br>
apartment buildings as well as the upgrading of its sewage <br>
treatment facilities.  This sewage treatment-upgrading project <br>
included construction of a new aerated complete mix cell, <br>
replacement of the aeration system in the existing cells and <br>
installation of a new blower/motor and new manhole/control <br>
structures associated with piping and sewers.  Construction of <br>
this project was completed during the summer of 1993.<br>
<br>
In addition to these civil engineering assignments, Morrison <br>
Hershfield has provided building engineering services, including <br>
electrical, instrumentation and mechanical engineering for a <br>
retrofit of the firehall.  Mechanical, electrical and <br>
instrumentation engineering services were also provided for <br>
upgrading of the control and telemetry system for the Wainwright <br>
Regional Water Treatment Plant, which is located at the Canadian <br>
Forces Base Wainwright.<br>
<br>
In 1998-99 Morrison Hershfield provided design engineering for <br>
the approval and construction of a major stormwater drainage <br>
system which services the centre and business section of town.  <br>
The existing system was undersized and causing frequent flooding <br>
during the summer months.<br>
<br>
The new system, with a total length of 3000m, was comprised of <br>
three elements:  pipe, ditching and two stormwater detention <br>
ponds.  Because of limited clearances with existing utilities, <br>
round and arch CMP pipe was used, ranging in size from 750 mm to <br>
1790 X 1360 arch.<br>
 <br>
Currently, MH is carrying out a complete water network analysis <br>
having done a sanitary sewer system and stormwater drainage <br>
analysis over the last few years. Also at the present time, MH <br>
is designing two new subdivisions and an extension of servicing <br>
for a new institutional facility site.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
Morrison Hershfield Limited was contracted by the World Bank and <br>
the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to    <br>
complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential    <br>
sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries <br>
of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,   <br>
St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was<br>
to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal of <br>
     sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity <br>
to <br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkage with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy<br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing <br>
     countries, household income and preference govern whether a<br>
     community wants and can afford to implement any type of a <br>
     sewage system.<br>
<br>
The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report   <br>
was submitted in December, 1996.<br>
<br>
Client: World Bank/Organization of Eastern Caribbean States<br>
<br>
   <br>
 <br>
4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE <br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
The project involved the upgrading of the sewage sludge and <br>
liquid effluent handling system. During 1996, the liquid <br>
decanting system improvements were implemented, the sludge <br>
pumping equipment was purchased and commissioned, the existing <br>
pipelines were externally investigated and one section had the <br>
internal investigation completed.  The pre-design, design, EIA <br>
and construction of 5 km of new pipeline were completed in 1997.<br>
<br>
Subsequent to having been awarded the project, the TransAlta Co-<br>
Composter Facility was approved by City Council.  In addition, <br>
Celanese Canada requested a tie-in to the City sewage system.   <br>
These two events added substantially to the project by adding a <br>
second crossing of the river with an outfall from Celanese and <br>
changing the piping and valving so that sludge and filtrate <br>
could be delivered to the Co-Composter. Also designed and <br>
constructed was the piping and valving to enable the City to <br>
reclaim sludge and filtrate from the lagoons and deliver it to <br>
the Co-Composter.  Morrison Hershfield staff worked closely with <br>
Celanese and TransAlta personnel as well as the client, the City <br>
of Edmonton, to successfully design, construct and commission <br>
the reclaim system, pipeline and transfer valving.<br>
<br>
The new 250mm Dia. HDPE wastewater disposal pipeline for <br>
Celanese was included into the project because of the similar <br>
technical requirements to the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, <br>
the concurrent timing and the mutual economic benefits to the <br>
City and Celanese.  <br>
<br>
The installation of the pipelines was completed in 1997, with <br>
the Saskatchewan River crossing accomplished by the directional <br>
drilling method for both the steel and HDPE lines. Morrison <br>
Hershfield provided the design, contract drawings and <br>
specifications, project management and construction engineering <br>
services for the total project.<br>

1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
   As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
   depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
   de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil <br>
   drill pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other<br>
   oilfield wastes will require rehabilitation and in most cases,<br>
   disposal in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The most<br>
   efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound manner<br>
   of disposal for this oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a <br>
   Class-1 a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
   Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
   team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for  <br>
   the proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of    <br>
   hydrologists, geologists, environmentalists, landscape    <br>
   architects, biologists and public relations sub-consultants.  <br>
   Maxim&#39;s team completed the Public Disclosure and Public    <br>
   Information phase of the project in December 1996 and    <br>
   submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment and conceptual <br>
   design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
   Maxim prepared the detail design and application for Alberta <br>
   Environmental approval.  Approval has been received.  The    <br>
   landfill is scheduled for construction during the second half <br>
   of 1998.<br>

   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment aerated lagoon     <br>
   expansion.  The project was constructed during the summer of  <br>
   1993.  The lagoon expansion included construction of a new    <br>
   aerated complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system <br>
   in the existing facultative cells, new blower/motor    <br>
   installation and new manhole/control structures including all <br>
   associated piping and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide<br>
   mixing and oxygen entrainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.   An additional 192 new static<br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals for<br>
   construction.<br>

3. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and  <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential <br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries <br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,<br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was<br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal of <br>
     sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to <br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkage with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy<br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing <br>
     countries, household income and preference govern whether a<br>
     community wants and can afford to implement any type of a <br>
     sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE <br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
 - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
   systems;<br>
<br>
 - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
  <br>
 - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
   8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons<br>
   and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
 - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre <br>
   long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
   a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially <br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
composting facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilities transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

5. SUMMER VILLAGE OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy  <br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake,<br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environment impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird <br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

6. MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs for the resort and to satisfy the Federal  <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified<br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter<br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the<br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed<br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to <br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
   As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
   depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
   de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil    <br>
   drill pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other   <br>
   oilfield wastes will require rehabilitation and in most    <br>
   cases, disposal in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The <br>
   most efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound  <br>
   manner of disposal for this oilfield/industrial waste it to   <br>
   develop a Class 1-a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
   Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
   team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for  <br>
   the proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of    <br>
   hydrologists, geologists, environmentalists, landscape    <br>
   architects, biologists and public relations sub-consultants.  <br>
   Maxim&#39;s team completed the Public Disclosure and Public    <br>
   Information phase of the project in December 1996 and    <br>
   submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment and conceptual <br>
   design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
   Currently Maxim is preparing the detail design and application <br>
   for Alberta Environmental approval.  The landfill if scheduled <br>
   for construction during the second half of 1998.<br>

3. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and<br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential<br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries<br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, <br>
   St. Vincent &amp; Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was to <br>
   identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies<br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal of <br>
     sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to<br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy for<br>
     identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability and <br>
     willingness to pay.  In the context of developing countries,<br>
     household income and preference govern whether a community<br>
     wants and can afford to implement any type of a sewage <br>
     system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling  <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance<br>
     systems;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter  <br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially <br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and the pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility was approved, <br>
Maxim has worked closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate <br>
transporting sludge and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and <br>
to meet the operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy<br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, <br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Barid<br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

<br>
1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
   As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
   depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
   de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil    <br>
   drill pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other   <br>
   oilfield wastes will require rehabilitation and in most cases, <br>
   disposal in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The most   <br>
   efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound manner <br>
   of disposal for this oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a <br>
   Class-1 a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
   Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
   team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for  <br>
   the proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of    <br>
   hydrologists, geologists, environmentalists, landscape    <br>
   architects, biologists and public relations sub-consultants.  <br>
   Maxim&#39;s team completed the Public Disclosure and Public    <br>
   Information phase of the project in December 1996 and    <br>
   submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment and conceptual <br>
   design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
   Maxim prepared the detail design and application for Alberta <br>
   Environmental approval.  Approval has been received.  The    <br>
   landfill is scheduled for construction during the second half <br>
   of 1998.<br>
<br>
2. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment aerated lagoon     <br>
   expansion.  The project was constructed during the summer of  <br>
   1993.  The lagoon expansion included construction of a new    <br>
   aerated complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system <br>
   in the existing facultative cells, new blower/motor    <br>
   installation and new manhole/control structures including all <br>
   associated piping and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide<br>
   mixing and oxygen entrainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.   An additional 192 new static<br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals for<br>
   construction.<br>

3. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and  <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential <br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries <br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,<br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was<br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal of <br>
     sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to <br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkage with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy<br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing <br>
     countries, household income and preference govern whether a<br>
     community wants and can afford to implement any type of a <br>
     sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE <br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
 - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
   systems;<br>
<br>
 - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
  <br>
 - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
   8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons<br>
   and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
 - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre <br>
   long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
   a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially <br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
composting facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilities transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

5. SUMMER VILLAGE OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy  <br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake,<br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environment impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird <br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

<br>
6. MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs for the resort and to satisfy the Federal  <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified<br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter<br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the<br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed<br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to <br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance<br>
     systems;<br>
   <br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre <br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially<br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and the pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.)<br>
Composting Facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

5. SUMMER VILLAGE OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy  <br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, <br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird <br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with <br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

6. MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin<br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National <br>
   Park.  Subsequent to the preparation of a study which <br>
   identified alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs<br>
   and tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter<br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the <br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed <br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to<br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

<br>
1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
   As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
   depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
   de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil    <br>
   drill pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other   <br>
   oilfield wastes will require rehabilitation and in most cases, <br>
   disposal in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The most   <br>
   efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound manner <br>
   of disposal for this oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a <br>
   Class-1 a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
   Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
   team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for  <br>
   the proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of    <br>
   hydrologists, geologists, environmentalists, landscape    <br>
   architects, biologists and public relations sub-consultants.  <br>
   Maxim&#39;s team completed the Public Disclosure and Public    <br>
   Information phase of the project in December 1996 and    <br>
   submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment and conceptual <br>
   design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
   Maxim prepared the detail design and application for Alberta <br>
   Environmental approval.  Approval has been received.  The    <br>
   landfill is scheduled for construction during the second half <br>
   of 1998.<br>
<br>
2. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment aerated lagoon     <br>
   expansion.  The project was constructed during the summer of  <br>
   1993.  The lagoon expansion included construction of a new    <br>
   aerated complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system <br>
   in the existing facultative cells, new blower/motor    <br>
   installation and new manhole/control structures including all <br>
   associated piping and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide<br>
   mixing and oxygen entrainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.   An additional 192 new static<br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals for<br>
   construction.<br>

3. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and  <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential <br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries <br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia,<br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was<br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies <br>
   can assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report outlined what each country has to do in order to<br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope included the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal of <br>
     sewage.  This includes preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation<br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to <br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and<br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkage with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
<br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy<br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing <br>
     countries, household income and preference govern whether a<br>
     community wants and can afford to implement any type of a <br>
     sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

4. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE <br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City<br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
 - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
   systems;<br>
<br>
 - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
  <br>
 - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
   8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons<br>
   and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
 - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre <br>
   long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
   a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
At present, the decanting system improvements have been partially <br>
implemented, the sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline was <br>
completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
composting facility was approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. was <br>
included in the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilities transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.<br>

   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy  <br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake,<br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environment impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird <br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>

1. BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
   As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
   depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
   de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil    <br>
   drill pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other   <br>
   oilfield wastes will require proceeding and in most cases,    <br>
   disposal in an environmentally acceptable manner.  The most   <br>
   efficient and cost effective, yet environmentally sound manner <br>
   of disposal for this oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a <br>
   Class 1 a Industrial landfill.<br>
<br>
   Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
   team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for  <br>
   the proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of    <br>
   hydrologists, geologists, environmentalists, landscape    <br>
   architects, biologists and public relations sub-consultants.  <br>
   Maxim&#39;s team completed the Public Disclosure and Public    <br>
   Information phase of the project in December 1996 and    <br>
   submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment and conceptual <br>
   design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
   Currently Maxim is preparing the detail design and application <br>
   for Alberta Environmental approval.  The landfill if scheduled <br>
   for construction during the second half of 1998.<br>
<br>
2. SUMMER VILLAGES OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the <br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy<br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, <br>
   35 km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird<br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon<br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation and<br>
   design for a compacted-clay liner evaporation pond with <br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

3. MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the <br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter<br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the<br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed<br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to <br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

1. GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA<br>
   WATER PUMPING STATIONS/FACILITIES REHABILITATION<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by Guyana Water <br>
   Authority (GUYWA) to prepare preliminary rehabilitation<br>
   designs for thirty-five (35) water pumping stations/facilities <br>
   and detailed designs including preparation of bidding <br>
   documents for ten (10) pumping stations/facilities as part of<br>
   the World Bank funded Water Supply Technical Assistance and<br>
   Rehabilitation Project.  The programme objective with respect <br>
   to pumping stations/facilities is rehabilitation of existing <br>
   systems that have fallen into various states of disrepair over<br>
   a number of years as a direct result of insufficient <br>
   maintenance.<br>
<br>
   During the initial conditions inspections in late March, 1993, <br>
   it became apparent that a number of the 35 stations that had <br>
   been selected by GUYWA for pre-design were interconnected to <br>
   adjacent pumping stations/facilities.  The extent of the <br>
   interconnections was confirmed in June when it was determined<br>
   that the original list of 35 stations impacted on a total of <br>
   86 facilities.<br>
<br>
   The presence of extensive interconnected systems meant that <br>
   the World Bank&#39;s original programme strategy to rehabilitate<br>
   individual pumping stations/facilities was no longer cost <br>
   effective.  Maxim Engineering Inc. developed a new approach <br>
   focusing on rehabilitation of interconnected systems with an<br>
   emphasis on reducing the overall number of pumping stations <br>
   and associated operating and maintenance costs.<br>
<br>
   Maxim finalized the pre-design reports for 7 major water <br>
   supply/treatment rehabilitation schemes (including complete   <br>
   distribution system reconstruction) servicing a total <br>
   population of 160,000.  We subsequently finalized detailed<br>
   rehabilitation designs and bidding documents for 6 water <br>
   treatment plants, 4 elevated storage towers, 27 water pumping<br>
   stations and associated interconnecting transmission mains for<br>
   the 7 systems.<br>
<br>
   In addition, Maxim was commissioned to conduct a site <br>
   evaluation of the existing Water Treatment Plant at Bartica<br>
   on the west bank of the Essiquibo River.  We were then <br>
   authorized to prepare a pre-design study, tender documents and <br>
   specifications for complete rehabilitation of the water <br>
   treatment plant.<br>

2. TOWN OF MILLET<br>
   WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION STUDY<br>
<br>
   The Town of Millet, with a population of 2,000, uses a       <br>
   water distribution network supplied by a central reservoir<br>
   which in turn is supplied by ground water wells.  A barely<br>
   sufficient water supply capacity and low system pressures<br>
   warranted an overall Water Supply and Distribution Study.<br>
<br>
   Data was collected and reviewed to assess the existing water <br>
   supply capacity.  Future Town populations were then projected<br>
   to identify future water supply needs.  The distribution <br>
   system was modelled utilizing the &quot;WATER&quot; computer program <br>
   and later calibrated using flow and system pressure data <br>
   collected in the field.  The calibrated model was used to <br>
   identify system modifications required to boost system <br>
   pressures now and in the future and to simulate future <br>
   expansion of the distribution system.  Recommendations for<br>
   phased construction of system and supply modifications were<br>
   submitted in report form.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to submission of our report, the Town commissioned<br>
   Maxim to retain a groundwater hydrologist to identify and <br>
   complete a suitable additional well water supply and <br>
   authorized Maxim to connect the wells to the existing <br>
   reservoir.  The new wells also generated upgrading of water<br>
   treatment plant controls and the installation of a new<br>
   distribution pump.  Maxim provided design plans and <br>
   specifications, received construction tenders, reviewed and<br>
   recommended for contract award and provided construction <br>
   inspection and contract administration.<br>

3. RESERVOIR REHABILITATION<br>
   TOWN OF EDSON<br>
<br>
   Maxim carried out site investigation work and prepared a <br>
   detailed feasibility study report for upgrading the five<br>
   potable water reservoirs for the Town of Edson.  These<br>
   reservoirs structures included an elevated steel tower<br>
   and tank (100 ft - 50,000 imperial gallon capacity), two<br>
   underground  tanks, one above ground concrete<br>
   tank (75 ft diameter x 30 ft high), and one above ground steel<br>
   tank (60 ft diameter x 30 ft high).  Only minor upgrading was <br>
   recommended for the concrete structures.  The steel reservoirs<br>
   however were in need or significant rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
   Following acceptance of our recommendations, Maxim was <br>
   commissioned to prepare the necessary design, to tender the<br>
   project, and to provide construction inspection and project<br>
   management services.  Remedial work included installation of <br>
   new foundation systems, sandblasting of steel, installation of <br>
   new fibreglass and epoxy liners, and new insulation for <br>
   exterior surfaces.<br>

   Cost:   $100,000<br>
<br>
4. CAMP WAINWRIGHT<br>
   WATER PRODUCTION SYSTEM AUTOMATION STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim was commissioned to study the potable water production <br>
   facilities located on Camp Wainwright to determine how to <br>
   automate the system to enable production hours to be expanded<br>
   from 12 to 24 hours while reducing required operating hours <br>
   from 12 to eight.<br>
<br>
   The existing system includes a river intake pumping station <br>
   which pumps raw water to a large raw water storage reservoir <br>
   (lake).  A conventional 1.5 MGD water treatment plant treats<br>
   raw water from the lake using clarification and filtration, <br>
   and then pumps the potable water to an underground storage<br>
   reservoir.  Booster pumps deliver the water, through metering<br>
   stations which monitor the flows, from the underground storage<br>
   to elevated storage reservoirs at the Town of Wainwright and <br>
   at Camp Central.<br>
<br>
   The water treatment plant had a programmable logic controller <br>
   (PLC) in which the automatic mode had not reliably operated<br>
   since installation.  A telemetry system used several terminal <br>
   units (RTU&#39;s) to link all the facilities to the water <br>
   treatment plant, except for the river pumping station which<br>
   is independently operated.  The RTU&#39;s did not operate   <br>
   reliably.<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel visited the site several times to collect <br>
   data, receive input from system operating personnel and <br>
   camp engineers, and share ideas.  As a result, Maxim personnel<br>
   gained a comprehensive understanding of the system and the <br>
   client&#39;s goals.  From this, a simple clear report was written<br>
   which identified the required changes to the existing control <br>
   and telemetry system, and to areas of the process in order to <br>
   automate the plant.<br>
<br>
   Changes to the control system included upgrading and <br>
   re-programming the PLC to provide automatic operation,<br>
   installing a user friendly computerized Man Machine Interface<br>
   (MMI) to assist operators to control, track and manage the <br>
   system, installing new reliable RTU&#39;s to relay information    <br>
   from all the remote facilities over existing telephone lines<br>
   to the PLC and the MMI.  Changes to the process included <br>
   installing new pumps, valves, and instrumentation to support<br>
   24 hour operation.<br>
<br>
   The report was well received and implementation of the <br>
   recommendations was completed.<br>

1. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment lagoon expansion.  <br>
   The project was constructed during the summer of 1993.  The<br>
   lagoon expansion included construction of a new aerated <br>
   complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system in the <br>
   existing facultative cells, new blower/motor installation and <br>
   new manhole/control structures including all associated piping<br>
   and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide <br>
   mixing and oxygen entertainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.  An additional 192 new static <br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals<br>
   for construction.<br>

2. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank <br>
   and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to do <br>
   a pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential sewerage and <br>
   sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries of St. Kitts &amp; <br>
   Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent &amp; <br>
   the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was to identify <br>
   priority projects in each of the countries and to develop a <br>
   framework by which international lending agencies can assess  <br>
   the feasibility of financing these projects.  The final report <br>
   also outlined what each country has to do in order to <br>
   implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope includes the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal<br>
     of sewage.  This included preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation <br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to<br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and <br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
   <br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy <br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing<br>
     countries, household income and preferences govern whether<br>
     a community wants and can afford to implement any type of <br>
     a sewage system.<br>
<br>
     The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
     was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

3. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City <br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
     system;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
The decanting system improvements have been implemented, the <br>
sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and commissioned, the <br>
existing pipelines have been externally investigated and one <br>
section has had the internal investigation completed, and the <br>
pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline are were completed.<br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility has been approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. has been <br>
included into the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline doubled the estimated total project <br>
cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.  The project was tendered <br>
and construction management provided by Maxim.<br>

4. SUMMER VILLAGES OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the<br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy<br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, 35 <br>
   km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird<br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon <br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

   MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter <br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the <br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed <br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to<br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

1. EAST WAINWRIGHT SUBDIVISION<br>
<br>
   In 1990 Maxim was retained by the Town of Wainwright, Alberta<br>
   to provide engineering design services for a new subdivision. <br>
   The project began with a servicing study for a proposed 180 <br>
   hectare residential and commercial development at the east end<br>
   of the Town.  The study involved a detailed analysis of the <br>
   existing water supply, sanitary sewer, and storm water <br>
   drainage systems to determine their capacity to accommodate<br>
   post development demands.<br>
<br>
   Storm water management was a particularly high priority in the<br>
   servicing study.  Development of the new subdivision would <br>
   increase the rate of runoff to two of the Town&#39;s storm <br>
   drainage systems.  One was already overloaded; therefore a    <br>
   parallel storm sewer was designed to raise the system&#39;s level<br>
   of service to an acceptable standard.  The other system would <br>
   carry runoff from most of the proposed development, and would<br>
   be affected significantly by the increased rate of runoff.  <br>
   Two storm water detention ponds were included in the storm<br>
   system design of the new subdivision, to reduce the rate of <br>
   outflow to the existing system to a manageable level.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to the servicing study, Maxim performed the<br>
   detailed design of underground services, drainage systems,<br>
   and road work for the first four phases of the new <br>
   development.  They include approximately 150 residential lots<br>
   as well as commercial property.<br>

2. MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS - ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel provided the engineering design, field layout <br>
   and construction supervision services for the site grading,<br>
   sanitary sewers, water mains, asphaltic concrete pavement<br>
   (with concrete curb and gutter) and storm sewers for several<br>
   multi-family housing developments such as the 70 Unit <br>
   Development, 56 Unit Development, 22 Unit Development and <br>
   42 Unit Development all in Castledowns.<br>
<br>
   Our office completed the pre-design of Stage I and II of a <br>
   400 Unit Development in South Ridge (Huntington Hill) and <br>
   was involved in the construction phase of Stage I for 100<br>
   Units of the Huntington Hill Development.<br>
<br>
   A subsequent project included design and construction of <br>
   Phase II -- 112 units and for Phase III - 32 units.  Both<br>
   phases included special designs for retention of storm water<br>
   on the new parking lots, and restriction of outflow rates<br>
   to the existing City system.<br>

3. WHITEMUD DRIVE DRAINAGE DESIGN<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were retained by the City of Edmonton  to <br>
   design the storm water drainage system for Whitemud Drive<br>
   between 99 Street and 106 Street.  The design required the use<br>
   of the Storm Water Management Model SWMM3 and a detailed <br>
   analysis of the drainage pattern of the land within and<br>
   adjacent to the proposed freeway, to determine the potential<br>
   volume and rate of runoff which could flow into the depressed <br>
   Whitemud freeway.  Due to limited excess capacity in the <br>
   existing storm sewer system, a 10,300 m cubed underground    <br>
   storage vault was designed to retain excess runoff.<br>
<br>
   The storage vault is located beneath the roadway, and consists <br>
   of a flat plate roof system, interior columns, and a raft type<br>
   foundation system.  Construction was carried out in six <br>
   different &quot;segments&quot;, producing a storage reservoir <br>
   approximately 44 m x 66 m x 5 m high.  Construction involved <br>
   over 3700 m cubed of cast-in-place concrete, and approximately<br>
   300,000 kg of epoxy coated and normal reinforcing steel.  <br>
   Interior and exterior waterproofing was also provided.<br>
<br>
   A &quot;hydrovex&quot; flow restriction device and a gate valve system<br>
   were included in the design to control the rate of outflow to<br>
   the existing storm sewer after the storm has subsided.  The<br>
   depth of the existing receiving sewer necessitated the design<br>
   and construction of three new &quot;drop manholes&quot;.  Water <br>
   entering each manhole plunges down to 20 m through a drop    <br>
   shaft into a lower chamber.  The lower chamber has a    <br>
   cast-in-place wall whose height and position are specially    <br>
   designed to reduce the kinetic energy of the storm water prior <br>
   to entering the receiving sewer.  Construction of the drainage <br>
   system was completed in late 1993.<br>

4. CITY OF EDMONTON - MILL WOODS DRAINAGE STUDY<br>
<br>
   The City of Edmonton, Environmental Services Department, <br>
   commissioned Maxim personnel to investigate and make<br>
   recommendations which would rectify basement flooding in<br>
   the Greenview subdivision of Mill Woods.  The study required<br>
   the review of street drainage and ponding, cross filtration<br>
   between storm and sanitary sewers, determination of ground<br>
   water infiltration and infiltration through foundation weeping<br>
   tile.  The alternative solutions included the installation of<br>
   an additional pipe system, surface or underground storage <br>
   and/or elimination of infiltration at the source.  The initial<br>
   report documented the frequency and volume of extraneous flow<br>
   resulting from rainfall, presented alternative remedial<br>
   measures.<br>
<br>
   A second phase included the installation of basement sump <br>
   pumps in existing homes which interrupted weeping tile flow<br>
   for discharge to the ground surface outside the home.  Our<br>
   program included data recorders and telemetry systems for <br>
   remote retrieval of sump pump operating records, and <br>
   installation of sewage flow and level recorders.  The analysis<br>
   of data utilized the Storm Water Management Model program to <br>
   simulate the sewer system flow conditions.  It was calibrated <br>
   to previous storm events, and used to estimate hydraulic grade<br>
   lines for future design storm events.  The result of data <br>
   analysis was that storage of extraneous flows was a more <br>
   efficient solution in Greenview than intercepting flows with<br>
   sump pumps.<br>

5. 153 AVENUE DRAINAGE DESIGN<br>
<br>
   The City of Edmonton Works Department, retained Maxim to <br>
   design the stormwater drainage system for a 1.5 kilometre<br>
   section of 153 Avenue between Fort Road and 18 Street.  The<br>
   new roadway intersected two natural drainage basins; thus<br>
   both overland and roadway drainage had to be accommodated.<br>
   Overland stormwater flows to had to be limited to <br>
   pre-development levels, and surface storage was incorporated<br>
   to meet this objective.  A 10,000 m cubed stormwater retention<br>
   pond was designed to intercept both natural and roadway <br>
   overland flow for release to the roadway piped system<br>
   following storm dissipation.  This facility included full<br>
   flow control complete with telemetry tied to the receiving<br>
   stormwater trunk sewer flows.<br>
<br>
   Roadway drainage to the 1:10 year storm event level was dealt<br>
   with by means of a piped conveyance system.  This system<br>
   included all required catchbains, catchbasin manholes, <br>
   manholes and storm sewer piping necessary to tie into an <br>
   existing storm sewer trunk.  The 11 m depth of the trunk<br>
   required design of a drop manhole and energy dissipater in <br>
   order to limit sewer drainage caused by high velocity flows.<br>
   A flow control orifice was incorporated into the piped system<br>
   to accommodate limited capacity in the receiving stormwater<br>
   trunk.<br>

1. GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA<br>
   WATER PUMPING STATIONS/FACILITIES REHABILITATION<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by Guyana Water <br>
   Authority (GUYWA) to prepare preliminary rehabilitation<br>
   designs for thirty-five (35) water pumping stations/facilities <br>
   and detailed designs including preparation of bidding <br>
   documents for ten (10) pumping stations/facilities as part of<br>
   the World Bank funded Water Supply Technical Assistance and<br>
   Rehabilitation Project.  The programme objective with respect <br>
   to pumping stations/facilities is rehabilitation of existing <br>
   systems that have fallen into various states of disrepair over<br>
   a number of years as a direct result of insufficient <br>
   maintenance.<br>
<br>
   During the initial conditions inspections in late March, 1993, <br>
   it became apparent that a number of the 35 stations that had <br>
   been selected by GUYWA for pre-design were interconnected to <br>
   adjacent pumping stations/facilities.  The extent of the <br>
   interconnections was confirmed in June when it was determined<br>
   that the original list of 35 stations impacted on a total of <br>
   86 facilities.<br>
<br>
   The presence of extensive interconnected systems meant that <br>
   the World Bank&#39;s original programme strategy to rehabilitate<br>
   individual pumping stations/facilities was no longer cost <br>
   effective.  Maxim Engineering Inc. developed a new approach <br>
   focusing on rehabilitation of interconnected systems with an<br>
   emphasis on reducing the overall number of pumping stations <br>
   and associated operating and maintenance costs.<br>
<br>
   Maxim finalized the pre-design reports for 7 major water <br>
   supply/treatment rehabilitation schemes (including complete   <br>
   distribution system reconstruction) servicing a total <br>
   population of 160,000.  We subsequently finalized detailed<br>
   rehabilitation designs and bidding documents for 6 water <br>
   treatment plants, 4 elevated storage towers, 27 water pumping<br>
   stations and associated interconnecting transmission mains for<br>
   the 7 systems.<br>
<br>
   In addition, Maxim was commissioned to conduct a site <br>
   evaluation of the existing Water Treatment Plant at Bartica<br>
   on the west bank of the Essiquibo River.  We were then <br>
   authorized to prepare a pre-design study, tender documents and <br>
   specifications for complete rehabilitation of the water <br>
   treatment plant.<br>

2. TOWN OF MILLET<br>
   WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION STUDY<br>
<br>
   The Town of Millet, with a population of 2,000, uses a       <br>
   water distribution network supplied by a central reservoir<br>
   which in turn is supplied by ground water wells.  A barely<br>
   sufficient water supply capacity and low system pressures<br>
   warranted an overall Water Supply and Distribution Study.<br>
<br>
   Data was collected and reviewed to assess the existing water <br>
   supply capacity.  Future Town populations were then projected<br>
   to identify future water supply needs.  The distribution <br>
   system was modelled utilizing the &quot;WATER&quot; computer program <br>
   and later calibrated using flow and system pressure data <br>
   collected in the field.  The calibrated model was used to <br>
   identify system modifications required to boost system <br>
   pressures now and in the future and to stimulate future <br>
   expansion of the distribution system.  Recommendations for<br>
   phased construction of system and supply modifications were<br>
   submitted in report form.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to submission of our report, the Town commissioned<br>
   Maxim to retain a groundwater hydrologist to identify and <br>
   complete a suitable additional well water supply and <br>
   authorized Maxim to connect the wells to the existing <br>
   reservoir.  The new walls also generated upgrading of water<br>
   treatment plant controls and the installation of a new<br>
   distribution pump.  Maxim provided design plans and <br>
   specifications, received construction tenders, reviewed and<br>
   recommended for contract award and provided construction <br>
   inspection and contract administration.<br>

3. RESERVOIR REHABILITATION<br>
   TOWN OF EDSON<br>
<br>
   Maxim carried out site investigation work and prepared a <br>
   detailed feasibility study report for upgrading the five<br>
   potable water reservoirs for the Town of Edson.  These<br>
   reservoirs structures included an elevated steel tower<br>
   and tank (100 ft - 50,000 imperial gallon capacity), two<br>
   underground concrete tanks, one above ground concrete<br>
   tank (75 ft diameter x 30 ft high), and one above ground steel<br>
   tank (60 ft diameter x 30 ft high).  Only minor upgrading was <br>
   recommended for the concrete structures.  The steel reservoirs<br>
   however were in need or significant rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
   Following acceptance of our recommendations, Maxim was <br>
   commissioned to prepare the necessary design, to tender the<br>
   project, and to provide construction inspection and project<br>
   management services.  Remedial work included installation of <br>
   new foundation systems, sandblasting of steel, installation of <br>
   new fibreglass and epoxy liners, and new insulation for <br>
   exterior surfaces.<br>

4. CAMP WAINWRIGHT<br>
   WATER PRODUCTION SYSTEM AUTOMATION STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim was commissioned to study the potable water production <br>
   facilities located on Camp Wainwright to determine how to <br>
   automate the system to enable production hours to be expanded<br>
   from 12 to 24 hours while reducing required operating hours <br>
   from 12 to eight.<br>
<br>
   The existing system includes a river intake pumping station <br>
   which pumps raw water to a large raw water storage reservoir <br>
   (lake).  A conventional 1.5 MGD water treatment plant treats<br>
   raw water from the lake using clarification and filtration, <br>
   and then pumps the potable water to an underground storage<br>
   reservoir.  Booster pumps deliver the water, through metering<br>
   stations which monitor the flows, from the underground storage<br>
   to elevated storage reservoirs at the Town of Wainwright and <br>
   at Camp Central.<br>
<br>
   The water treatment plant has a programmable logic controller <br>
   (PLC) in which the automatic mode has not reliably operated<br>
   since installation.  A telemetry system uses several terminal <br>
   units (RTU&#39;s) to link all the facilities to the water <br>
   treatment plant, except for the river pumping station which<br>
   is independently operated.  The RTU&#39;s do not operate   <br>
   reliably.<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel visited the site several times to collect <br>
   data, receive input from system operating personnel and <br>
   camp engineers, and share ideas.  As a result, Maxim personnel<br>
   gained a comprehensive understanding of the system and the <br>
   client&#39;s goals.  From this, a simply clear report was written<br>
   which identified the required changes to the existing control <br>
   and telemetry system, and to areas of the process in order to <br>
   automate the plant.<br>
<br>
   Changes to the control system included upgrading and <br>
   re-programming the PLC to provide automatic operation,<br>
   installing a user friendly computerized Man Machine Interface<br>
   (MMI) to assist operators to control, track and manage the <br>
   system, installing new reliable RTU&#39;s to relay information    <br>
   from all the remote facilities over existing telephone lines<br>
   to the PLC and the MMI.  Changes to the process included <br>
   installing new pumps, valves, and instrumentation to support<br>
   24 hour operation.<br>
<br>
   The report was implemented and the construction is now <br>
   complete.<br>

BYRAM INDUSTRIAL SERVICES LTD. - PEMBINA AREA LANDFILL<br>
<br>
As the Pembina Cardium oilfield in west central Alberta is <br>
depleted, the oil well, battery and process facilities will be <br>
de-commissioned.  As part of this site clean-up soils, oil drill <br>
pits, flare pits, tank bases and a multitude of other oilfield <br>
wastes will require proceeding and in most cases, disposal in an <br>
environmentally acceptable manner.  The most efficient and cost <br>
effective, yet environmentally sound manner of disposal for this <br>
oilfield/industrial waste it to develop a Class 1 a Industrial <br>
landfill.<br>
<br>
Byram commissioned Maxim Engineering Inc. to lead and manage a <br>
team of scientists and engineers to find a site suitable for the <br>
proposed landfill.  Maxim&#39;s team consisted of hydrologists, <br>
geologists, environmentalists, landscape architects, biologists <br>
and public relations sub-consultants.  Maxim&#39;s team completed the <br>
Public Disclosure and Public Information phase of the project in <br>
December 1996 and submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment <br>
and conceptual design December, 1997.<br>
<br>
Currently Maxim is preparing the detail design and application <br>
for Alberta Environmental approval.  The landfill if scheduled <br>
for construction during the second half of 1998.<br>

1. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT EXPANSION - WAINWRIGHT, ALBERTA<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering provided pre-design and detailed engineering <br>
   services for Wainwright&#39;s sewage treatment lagoon expansion.  <br>
   The project was constructed during the summer of 1993.  The<br>
   lagoon expansion included construction of a new aerated <br>
   complete mix cell, replacement of the aeration system in the <br>
   existing facultative cells, new blower/motor installation and <br>
   new manhole/control structures including all associated piping<br>
   and sewers.<br>
<br>
   A total of 145 static tube aerators were installed to provide <br>
   mixing and oxygen entertainment in the complete mix cell.  A <br>
   synthetic liner prevents contamination of groundwater in the <br>
   predominantly silty/sandy soil.  An additional 192 new static <br>
   tube aerators provide aeration for the two existing <br>
   facultative cells.  Air for all static tubes is provided by <br>
   five 40 Hp blowers with one acting as standby.  The air <br>
   provided to operate the whole facility totals 3800 cubic feet<br>
   per minute (1800 litres per second).<br>
<br>
   Maxim also acted as liaison between the Town and various <br>
   permitting agencies in obtaining the required approvals<br>
   for construction.<br>

2. ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES<br>
   SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE TREATMENT STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was contracted by the World Bank and   <br>
   the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to <br>
   complete pre-feasibility study of proposed and potential    <br>
   sewerage and sewage treatment projects in the OECS countries  <br>
   of St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, St. Lucia, <br>
   St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines and Grenada.  The objective was  <br>
   to identify priority projects in each of the countries and to <br>
   develop a framework by which international lending agencies   <br>
   could assess the feasibility of financing these projects.  The <br>
   final report would also outline what each country has to do in <br>
   order to implement particular projects.<br>
<br>
   The project scope includes the following aspects:<br>
<br>
   - Technical Aspects - determination of appropriate <br>
     technologies for collection, treatment and disposal<br>
     of sewage.  This included preliminary layout of collection<br>
     systems, comparison of treatment methods, and determination<br>
     of appropriate disposal options including land based <br>
     solutions and submarine ocean outfalls.  The investigation <br>
     included an assessment required for each project and a <br>
     cost/benefit analysis of the alternative presented.<br>
<br>
   - Institutional/Legislative - in order to properly implement<br>
     the proposed technical solutions, each country&#39;s capacity to<br>
     operate, maintain and regulate sewage facilities was <br>
     evaluated.  This included an analysis of designated <br>
     management and technical personnel in the National Water and <br>
     Sewage Authority, organization structure, management <br>
     information systems, current cost recovery measures, <br>
     applicable legislation and regulations, linkages with<br>
     regulatory and planning authorities etc.<br>
   <br>
   - Socio/Economic - included in the implementation strategy <br>
     for identified priority projects is the people&#39;s ability<br>
     and willingness to pay.  In the context of developing<br>
     countries, household income and preferences govern whether<br>
     a community wants and can afford to implement any type of <br>
     a sewage system.<br>
<br>
   The project commenced in January, 1996 and the final report <br>
   was submitted in December, 1996.<br>

3. CLOVER BAR SLUDGE LAGOONS &amp; SUPERNATANT PIPELINE<br>
   GOLD BAR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT - EDMONTON<br>
<br>
   In 1995, Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by the City <br>
   of Edmonton to upgrade solids and liquids handling <br>
   capability/capacity at the City&#39;s Clover Bar Sludge Lagoons.<br>
   The project scope of work included:<br>
<br>
   - upgrading of the lagoon underground decant/conveyance <br>
     system;<br>
<br>
   - a floating lagoon pumper, and a cutter suction dredge;<br>
<br>
   - an internal/external integrity investigation on the existing<br>
     8 inch diameter steel pipelines between Clover Bar Lagoons <br>
     and the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant, and;<br>
<br>
   - pre-design, design and construction of a new 5 kilometre<br>
     long, 300 mm diameter, supernatant/sludge pipeline including<br>
     a full environmental impact assessment (EIA).<br>
<br>
The decanting system improvements have been implemented, the <br>
sludge pumping equipment has been purchased and <br>
commissioned, the existing pipelines have been externally <br>
investigated and one section has had the internal investigation <br>
completed, and the pre-design and EIA for the new pipeline have <br>
been completed.  <br>
<br>
Since the project commenced in 1995, the TransAlta (T.E.N.) <br>
Composting Facility has been approved by City Council and a new <br>
wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese Canada Inc. has been <br>
included into the project.  The composting facility impacted <br>
significantly on the pipeline portion of the City project because <br>
sludge from Gold Bar and Clover Bar Lagoons (CBL) must now be <br>
delivered to the T.E.N. site rather than from Gold Bar to CBL.  <br>
Since the composting facility was approved, Maxim has worked <br>
closely with TransAlta staff to facilitate transporting sludge <br>
and filtrate to and from the T.E.N. site and to meet the <br>
operation requirements of T.E.N. and the City.<br>
<br>
The new wastewater disposal pipeline for Celanese was included <br>
into the project because of its similar technical requirements to <br>
the new sludge/supernatant pipeline, the concurrent timing and <br>
the mutual economic benefits to the City and Celanese.  Inclusion <br>
of this second new pipeline has doubled the estimated total <br>
project cost from $2.5 million to $5 million.  The project was <br>
designed, tendered and construction management provided by Maxim.<br>

4. SUMMER VILLAGES OF SANDY BEACH AND SUNRISE<br>
   REGIONAL SEWAGE LAGOON<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned to prepare the<br>
   feasibility study, detailed design, tender packages, general<br>
   engineering, and resident construction inspection for a <br>
   regional evaporation lagoon for the Summer Villages of Sandy<br>
   Beach and Sunrise.<br>
<br>
   The communities are situated on the shores of Sandy Lake, 35 <br>
   km west of Morinville, and the implementation of a regional<br>
   lagoon had to be undertaken so that it would not have a <br>
   negative environmental impact on either Sandy Lake or Baird<br>
   Lake, located on Alexander Indian Band property to the east.<br>
<br>
   The project included determination of design flows based upon <br>
   available records, site selection, geotechnical evaluation<br>
   and design for a compacted-clay lined evaporation pond with<br>
   controlled access dumping.<br>

   MARMOT BASIN SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEM<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel were commissioned to conduct evaluation of the<br>
   existing sewage treatment facilities for the Marmot Basin <br>
   recreation ski area.  The project was to make recommendations<br>
   for the expansion of sewage treatment capability to meet the <br>
   future needs of the resort and to satisfy the Federal <br>
   Government discharge requirements within Jasper National Park.<br>
   Subsequent to the preparation of a study which identified <br>
   alternative treatment systems, we prepared designs and <br>
   tendered the installation of 2,400 m of 200 mm diameter <br>
   polyethylene sewer line and a sewage lagoon to replace the <br>
   existing package treatment plants.  The lagoon was designed <br>
   for high altitude conditions and used a synthetic liner to<br>
   prevent environmental damage to the surrounding area.  The <br>
   system is complete and in operation.<br>

1. GUYANA, SOUTH AMERICA<br>
   WATER PUMPING STATIONS/FACILITIES REHABILITATION<br>
<br>
   Maxim Engineering Inc. was commissioned by Guyana Water <br>
   Authority (GUYWA) to prepare preliminary rehabilitation<br>
   designs for thirty-five (35) water pumping stations/facilities <br>
   and detailed designs including preparation of bidding <br>
   documents for ten (10) pumping stations/facilities as part of<br>
   the World Bank funded Water Supply Technical Assistance and<br>
   Rehabilitation Project.  The programme objective with respect <br>
   to pumping stations/facilities is rehabilitation of existing <br>
   systems that have fallen into various states of disrepair over<br>
   a number of years as a direct result of insufficient <br>
   maintenance.<br>
<br>
   During the initial conditions inspections in late March, 1993, <br>
   it became apparent that a number of the 35 stations that had <br>
   been selected by GUYWA for pre-design were interconnected to <br>
   adjacent pumping stations/facilities.  The extent of the <br>
   interconnections was confirmed in June when it was determined<br>
   that the original list of 35 stations impacted on a total of <br>
   86 facilities.<br>
<br>
   The presence of extensive interconnected systems meant that <br>
   the World Bank&#39;s original programme strategy to rehabilitate<br>
   individual pumping stations/facilities was no longer cost <br>
   effective.  Maxim Engineering Inc. developed a new approach <br>
   focusing on rehabilitation of interconnected systems with an<br>
   emphasis on reducing the overall number of pumping stations <br>
   and associated operating and maintenance costs.<br>
<br>
   Maxim finalized the pre-design reports for 7 major water <br>
   supply/treatment rehabilitation schemes (including complete   <br>
   distribution system reconstruction) servicing a total <br>
   population of 160,000.  We subsequently finalized detailed<br>
   rehabilitation designs and bidding documents for 6 water <br>
   treatment plants, 4 elevated storage towers, 27 water pumping<br>
   stations and associated interconnecting transmission mains for<br>
   the 7 systems.<br>
<br>
   In addition, Maxim was commissioned to conduct a site <br>
   evaluation of the existing Water Treatment Plant at Bartica<br>
   on the west bank of the Essiquibo River.  We were then <br>
   authorized to prepare a pre-design study, tender documents and <br>
   specifications for complete rehabilitation of the water <br>
   treatment plant.<br>

2. TOWN OF MILLET<br>
   WATER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION STUDY<br>
<br>
   The Town of Millet, with a population of 2,000, uses a       <br>
   water distribution network supplied by a central reservoir<br>
   which in turn is supplied by ground water wells.  A barely<br>
   sufficient water supply capacity and low system pressures<br>
   warranted an overall Water Supply and Distribution Study.<br>
<br>
   Data was collected and reviewed to assess the existing water <br>
   supply capacity.  Future Town populations were then projected<br>
   to identify future water supply needs.  The distribution <br>
   system was modelled utilizing the &quot;WATER&quot; computer program <br>
   and later calibrated using flow and system pressure data <br>
   collected in the field.  The calibrated model was used to <br>
   identify system modifications required to boost system <br>
   pressures now and in the future and to stimulate future <br>
   expansion of the distribution system.  Recommendations for<br>
   phased construction of system and supply modifications were<br>
   submitted in report form.<br>
<br>
   Subsequent to submission of our report, the Town commissioned<br>
   Maxim to retain a groundwater hydrologist to identify and <br>
   complete a suitable additional well water supply and <br>
   authorized Maxim to connect the wells to the existing <br>
   reservoir.  The new walls also generated upgrading of water<br>
   treatment plant controls and the installation of a new<br>
   distribution pump.  Maxim provided design plans and <br>
   specifications, received construction tenders, reviewed and<br>
   recommended for contract award and provided construction <br>
   inspection and contract administration.<br>

3. RESERVOIR REHABILITATION<br>
   TOWN OF EDSON<br>
<br>
   Maxim carried out site investigation work and prepared a <br>
   detailed feasibility study report for upgrading the five<br>
   potable water reservoirs for the Town of Edson.  These<br>
   reservoirs structures included an elevated steel tower<br>
   and tank (100 ft - 50,000 imperial gallon capacity), two<br>
   underground concrete tanks, one above ground concrete<br>
   tank (75 ft diameter x 30 ft high), and one above ground steel<br>
   tank (60 ft diameter x 30 ft high).  Only minor upgrading was <br>
   recommended for the concrete structures.  The steel reservoirs<br>
   however were in need or significant rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
   Following acceptance of our recommendations, Maxim was <br>
   commissioned to prepare the necessary design, to tender the<br>
   project, and to provide construction inspection and project<br>
   management services.  Remedial work included installation of <br>
   new foundation systems, sandblasting of steel, installation of <br>
   new fibreglass and epoxy liners, and new insulation for <br>
   exterior surfaces.<br>

4. CAMP WAINWRIGHT<br>
   WATER PRODUCTION SYSTEM AUTOMATION STUDY<br>
<br>
   Maxim was commissioned to study the potable water production <br>
   facilities located on Camp Wainwright to determine how to <br>
   automate the system to enable production hours to be expanded<br>
   from 12 to 24 hours while reducing required operating hours <br>
   from 12 to eight.<br>
<br>
   The existing system includes a river intake pumping station <br>
   which pumps raw water to a large raw water storage reservoir <br>
   (lake).  A conventional 1.5 MGD water treatment plant treats<br>
   raw water from the lake using clarification and filtration, <br>
   and then pumps the potable water to an underground storage<br>
   reservoir.  Booster pumps deliver the water, through metering<br>
   stations which monitor the flows, from the underground storage<br>
   to elevated storage reservoirs at the Town of Wainwright and <br>
   at Camp Central.<br>
<br>
   The water treatment plant had a programmable logic controller <br>
   (PLC) in which the automatic mode was not reliably operated<br>
   since installation.  A telemetry system used several terminal <br>
   units (RTU&#39;s) to link all the facilities to the water <br>
   treatment plant, except for the river pumping station which<br>
   is independently operated.  The RTU&#39;s did not operate   <br>
   reliably.<br>
<br>
   Maxim personnel visited the site several times to collect <br>
   data, receive input from system operating personnel and <br>
   camp engineers, and share ideas.  As a result, Maxim personnel<br>
   gained a comprehensive understanding of the system and the <br>
   client&#39;s goals.  From this, a simple clear report was written<br>
   which identified the required changes to the existing control <br>
   and telemetry system, and to areas of the process in order to <br>
   automate the plant.<br>
<br>
   Changes to the control system included upgrading and <br>
   re-programming the PLC to provide automatic operation,<br>
   installing a user friendly computerized Man Machine Interface<br>
   (MMI) to assist operators to control, track and manage the <br>
   system, installing new reliable RTU&#39;s to relay information    <br>
   from all the remote facilities over existing telephone lines<br>
   to the PLC and the MMI.  Changes to the process included <br>
   installing new pumps, valves, and instrumentation to support<br>
   24 hour operation.<br>
<br>
   The report was and implemented and the construction is <br>
   complete.<br>

five-year period examining the University¡¦s renewals funding <br>
needs and providing a framework for gathering, organizing and <br>
rationalizing its funding needs. This allowed the University to <br>
effectively present its renewals funding requirements to funding <br>
agencies. The project examined and presented various funding <br>
scenarios, which allowed the University to reduce its deferred <br>
maintenance backlog and return to a more balanced funding versus <br>
renewal needs profile.<br>
