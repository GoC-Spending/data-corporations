<br>
Who - Engineers, technologists and managers who engage in solving challenging problems and/or leading continuous improvement initiatives. <br>
<br>
What - This workshop equips the participants with the knowledge required to systemize problem-solving processes. What are the drivers and inhibitors of creativity? How can creative intelligence be enhanced? The content includes practical lessons and activities using TRIZ, the theory of inventive problem-solving, as well as TRIZ&#39; effective toolboxes that inspire problem-solvers to find feasible answers.<br>

<br>
Who - A cross-functional team of 6-8 people who represent the operational processes that participate in the value stream being examined for improvement. We will assist in the team selection process.<br>
<br>
What - The participants will receive the necessary orientation to prepare them for participating in the event. Our facilitator will guide the team through the steps required to take stock of the current state of the chosen pilot process, through measurements and focused observations. Once the current state is mapped, the group will be able to see clearly the pockets of &quot;waste&quot; as defined by &quot;Lean&quot;, as well as other signs of deficiency. The team will then map out a future state for the process, identify and prioritize the small-medium size projects that are needed to bridge the gap<br>

                            Why - To reap the benefits of Lean in high-variety-low-volume (HVLV) settings. A gross misunderstanding about Lean Systems is that they work fine for Toyota and other mass producing organizations, but not necessarily in other forms of business environments. Learn how to gain competitive edge if you are a custom producer or deliver products in short runs.<br>
<br>
Who - A must-take for senior and middle management of every non-mass-producing organization aspiring to sharpen their competitive edge and achieve operational excellence.<br>
<br>
What - This workshop provides modified concepts and methodologies of Lean, which apply to job shops, short run producers of HVLV goods and services as well as custom-making operations. It builds on our Operationalizing Lean workshop.<br>
<br>
How long - This is an 8-hour workshop, including a refresher on the basics of lean systems.<br>

                            Why - To introduce one of the most powerful Lean techniques through a pilot project that gives your people the opportunity to learn by doing. Outcome: a lean and more efficient value-adding process.<br>
<br>
Who - A cross-functional team of 6-8 people who represent the operational processes that participate in the value stream being examined for improvement. We will assist in the team selection process.<br>
<br>
What - The participants will receive the necessary orientation to prepare them for participating in the event. Our facilitator will guide the team through the steps required to take stock of the current state of the chosen pilot process, through measurements and focused observations. Once the current state is mapped, the group will be able to see clearly the pockets of &quot;waste&quot; as defined by &quot;Lean&quot;, as well as other signs of deficiency. The team will then map out a future state for the process, identify and prioritize the small-medium size projects that are needed to bridge the gap<br>

                            Why - To enhance workflow, safety and staff morale by reorganizing the physical space. This is a pilot event which is meant to visually demonstrate the effect of 5S on efficiencies and wellbeing of workspace occupants. The event has proven to be an effective step into introducing a sustainable culture of maintaining efficient and safe workplaces throughout the organization<br>
<br>
Who - A group of people who work in a common area.<br>
<br>
What - Our facilitator will work shoulder-to-shoulder with the staff on the floor and walk them through the 5S steps. The content includes an orientation piece at the front-end of the event.<br>
<br>
How long - This is a 1-2 day workshop, depending on the size of the pilot area chosen.<br>

                            Why: The purpose of this workshop is to train the participants on (a) productivity principles, (b) productivity in construction, (c) lean principles and waste identification (d) the application of lean in construction projects, (e) productivity drivers and deterrents, (f) productivity and movements on construction sites, (g) planning for productivity, (h) productive execution of project plans, (i) benchmarking productivity and continuous improvement.  <br>
<br>
Who: This workshop is ideal for project managers, site supervisors, trades team leaders, as well as the administrative supporting staff.  Our experience shows that mixing these groups in one room enriches the discussion and allows for various perspectives to be shared and examined in a collegial and non-threatening environment.<br>
<br>
What: By taking this workshop, the participants will be able to<br>
<br>
       	Understand the concept of productivity and its competitive effect in construction projects<br>
       	Learn what causes and what hinders productivity in construction activity <br>
       	Be sensitive in spotting and eliminating wasteful activity and improve productivity on the go <br>
       	Track, evaluate and modify non-value-adding movements of on job-sites<br>
       	Appreciate how productivity could be incorporated in project plans and how one could help<br>
       	Become familiar with the metrics used to measure productivity for incremental improvement<br>
<br>
How long: Depending on the intended intensity, this workshop could be delivered in one day or two days and combined with job-site activity <br>
