              <h4>
                Key / Major clients:
              </h4>
           
              Since incorporation in 1973 McGregor GeoScience has acted as both a prime contractor and sub-contractor on a wide variety of marine geophysical and environmental seabed surveys both domestically and internationally.  Although too many to list here, McGregor has performed services in a number of capacities ranging from QA/QC for client representation to provision of fully mobilized ships for seismic, route surveying, environmental, hazard and engineering as well as bathymetric surveys.  We offer clients the benefits of a wealth of experience based on present technologies and a team of scientists who can perform at the highest levels. The following describes recent McGregor survey programs to provide examples of our capability in three core areas of our business:<br>
<br>
Environmental Baseline and Monitoring Surveys<br>
<br>
1.	In 2009, 2010 and 2011, McGregor GeoScience completed a multi-million dollar multibeam, shallow hazards and environmental baseline survey for Cairn Energy, offshore Western Greenland above 70 degrees latitude in water depths ranging from 100m to 3000m.  The surveys involved the collection of over 6000 linear kilometers of high resolution multibeam bathymetry, over 2000 kilometers of shallow 2D seismic, benthic grab and box cores, gravity cores and underwater video/photographic surveys for faunal, habitat, and sediment and water column contaminant analysis in advance of a marine drilling program scheduled for 2010. This project was a 2 ship operation involving 25 science personnel and 21 ships personnel. McGregor was responsible for delivery of all final reports and charts and compiled ancillary information from the area. Environmental baseline reports were generated from the survey areas providing a comprehensive assessment of the environmental conditions, including baseline macrofaunal community data, and sediment and water column pollution measures for incorporation into subsequent monitoring programs.<br>
<br>
2.	In 2008, McGregor GeoScience provided seabed sampling services for a geochemical seabed survey in Baffin Bay, offshore Greenland.  The survey was conducted under the direction of Volcanic Basin Petroleum Research of Oslo, Norway. The sampling survey was carried out in water depths ranging from 400-1200 meter water depths using a combination of piston and gravity corers as well as Van veen and bucket dredge samplers. A subbottom profiler was used to give preliminary indication of the seabed type for sampling purposes as well as to provide other indicators such as depth to bedrock.  In total over 100 samples were brought onboard for preliminary analysis.  Some were also stored for post-mission test and analysis.  <br>
<br>
3.	In 2010-11 McGregor conducted a habitat mapping project for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans over a 4500 Sq. km. area in the Laurentian Channel.  Multibeam with backscatter and sub-bottom profiles were collected to establish the criteria for a seabed sampling program.  The samples and the acoustic data will be used to develop benthic habitat maps for the survey block.  The work was performed as part of the establishment of Canadas Oceans Strategy (COS) based on principles of sustainable development and integrated management. The Strategy provides for the development of tools necessary to carry out COS, tools such as the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Marine Environmental Quality (MEQ) guidelines, criteria and standards designed to conserve and protect ecosystem health within the context of Integrated Management (IM) Planning. Integrated Management commits to plan and manage human activities in a comprehensive manner, considering measures to conserve, protect and sustain use of ocean resources and shared use of ocean areas. The Government of Canada has established five Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs) where this coordinated approach is being practiced. The waters surrounding the eastern and southern portions of Newfoundland are part of the Placentia Bay-Grand Banks LOMA.  This area has been identified for the establishment of a new Oceans Act MPA.  The Laurentian Channel and Slope EBSA (Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area) are of great ecological importance to the PBGB LOMA ecosystem, ranking fifth of the 11 EBSAs identified by DFO Science. Sufficient baseline data significantly helps in determining conservation objectives, as well as knowledge of which monitoring methods will work and which would provide good indicators of MPA effectiveness. Knowledge of the physical oceanographic environment is important to understanding the ecosystem, to assist in boundary delineation, and to aid in the cause-effect assessment of changes over time in MPA species and habitats. Collection of multibeam data prior to groundtruthing/bottom sampling provides knowledge of where samples should be collected. Images of multibeam data provide valuable information on the diversity of the sea floor.<br>

Route Survey and Multibeam Bathymetry/Backscatter<br>
<br>
	McGregor personnel have participated in a number of surveys for routing and placement of marine cables and pipelines.  Typically this has meant the collection, processing, charting and interpretation of an array of data including side scan sonar, sub-bottom profiles, multibeam bathymetry, magnetometer, seabed samples and cores as well as video and still photography.<br>
<br>
1.	McGregors experience with the acquisition, processing and presentation of multibeam bathymetric data evolved through our collection of multibeam data and ground-truthing of the data for benthic habitat mapping, in concert with various members of the scallop fishing community in Nova Scotia.  This project produced benthic classification and mapping of scallop beds for a more accurate and reliable method of fishing and resource management in scallop productive zones.  The joint venture, commenced in 2000, resulted in the successful acquisition of 5,000 Sq. Km of multibeam bathymetry coverage on the upper Scotian Slope, and Scotian Shelf. In addition, McGregor staff have recently undertaken sophisticated analysis of the multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data from sites on the Scotian Shelf to generate predictive maps of scallop habitat, with a great deal of accuracy using species distribution modeling methods.<br>
<br>
2.	More recently McGregor conducted an extensive multibeam and backscatter survey in Foxe Basin, Nunavut. The survey was commissioned to find and chart a primary and secondary route for large ore ships to transport extracted iron ore from the Baffin Island region.  The survey resulted in the collection, processing and charting of over 10,000 line kilometers of multibeam data in just over 35 days.  In addition to high resolution multibeam bathymetry collection, the project required the collection and interpretation of side scan sonar and subbottom profiles in areas along the routes as well as at several loading dock facilities near the proposed mine site.  In addition to the collection of sonar and seismic data, tide gauges were also deployed and recovered along the route to enable an accurate representation of the depth data on hydrographic charts.  McGregor is currently (June 2011) on site in the Hudson Strait for completion of the multibeam route survey through the south Foxe Basin and Hudson Strait to the confluence of the David Strait.  The R/V Strait Signet will be on site until mid-October 2011 to complete the work.<br>
<br>
3.	Collection of 6000 line Km of multibeam data with backscatter for a large EA regional survey off west Greenland in 2009.  This data was collected in conjunction with subbottom profiles to assist in picking sample locations for benthic mapping.<br>

              <h4>
                Key / Major clients:
              </h4>
           
              Since incorporation in 1973 McGregor GeoScience has acted as both a prime contractor and sub-contractor on a wide variety of marine geophysical and environmental seabed surveys both domestically and internationally.  Although too many to list here, McGregor has performed services in a number of capacities ranging from QA/QC for client representation to provision of fully mobilized ships for seismic, route surveying, environmental, hazard and engineering as well as bathymetric surveys.  We offer clients the benefits of a wealth of experience based on present technologies and a team of scientists who can perform at the highest levels. The following describes recent McGregor survey programs to provide examples of our capability in three core areas of our business:<br>
<br>
Environmental Baseline and Monitoring Surveys<br>
<br>
1.	In 2009, 2010 and 2011, McGregor GeoScience completed a multi-million dollar multibeam, shallow hazards and environmental baseline survey for Cairn Energy, offshore Western Greenland above 70 degrees latitude in water depths ranging from 100m to 3000m.  The surveys involved the collection of over 6000 linear kilometers of high resolution multibeam bathymetry, over 2000 kilometers of shallow 2D seismic, benthic grab and box cores, gravity cores and underwater video/photographic surveys for faunal, habitat, and sediment and water column contaminant analysis in advance of a marine drilling program scheduled for 2010. This project was a 2 ship operation involving 25 science personnel and 21 ships personnel. McGregor was responsible for delivery of all final reports and charts and compiled ancillary information from the area. Environmental baseline reports were generated from the survey areas providing a comprehensive assessment of the environmental conditions, including baseline macrofaunal community data, and sediment and water column pollution measures for incorporation into subsequent monitoring programs.<br>
<br>
2.	In 2008, McGregor GeoScience provided seabed sampling services for a geochemical seabed survey in Baffin Bay, offshore Greenland.  The survey was conducted under the direction of Volcanic Basin Petroleum Research of Oslo, Norway. The sampling survey was carried out in water depths ranging from 400-1200 meter water depths using a combination of piston and gravity corers as well as Van veen and bucket dredge samplers. A subbottom profiler was used to give preliminary indication of the seabed type for sampling purposes as well as to provide other indicators such as depth to bedrock.  In total over 100 samples were brought onboard for preliminary analysis.  Some were also stored for post-mission test and analysis.  <br>
<br>
3.	In 2010-11 McGregor conducted a habitat mapping project for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans over a 4500 Sq. km. area in the Laurentian Channel.  Multibeam with backscatter and sub-bottom profiles were collected to establish the criteria for a seabed sampling program.  The samples and the acoustic data will be used to develop benthic habitat maps for the survey block.  The work was performed as part of the establishment of Canadas Oceans Strategy (COS) based on principles of sustainable development and integrated management. The Strategy provides for the development of tools necessary to carry out COS, tools such as the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Marine Environmental Quality (MEQ) guidelines, criteria and standards designed to conserve and protect ecosystem health within the context of Integrated Management (IM) Planning. Integrated Management commits to plan and manage human activities in a comprehensive manner, considering measures to conserve, protect and sustain use of ocean resources and shared use of ocean areas. The Government of Canada has established five Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs) where this coordinated approach is being practiced. The waters surrounding the eastern and southern portions of Newfoundland are part of the Placentia Bay-Grand Banks LOMA.  This area has been identified for the establishment of a new Oceans Act MPA.  The Laurentian Channel and Slope EBSA (Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area) are of great ecological importance to the PBGB LOMA ecosystem, ranking fifth of the 11 EBSAs identified by DFO Science. Sufficient baseline data significantly helps in determining conservation objectives, as well as knowledge of which monitoring methods will work and which would provide good indicators of MPA effectiveness. Knowledge of the physical oceanographic environment is important to understanding the ecosystem, to assist in boundary delineation, and to aid in the cause-effect assessment of changes over time in MPA species and habitats. Collection of multibeam data prior to groundtruthing/bottom sampling provides knowledge of where samples should be collected. Images of multibeam data provide valuable information on the diversity of the sea floor.<br>
<br>
Route Survey and Multibeam Bathymetry/Backscatter<br>
<br>
	McGregor personnel have participated in a number of surveys for routing and placement of marine cables and pipelines.  Typically this has meant the collection, processing, charting and interpretation of an array of data including side scan sonar, sub-bottom profiles, multibeam bathymetry, magnetometer, seabed samples and cores as well as video and still photography.<br>
<br>
1.	McGregors experience with the acquisition, processing and presentation of multibeam bathymetric data evolved through our collection of multibeam data and ground-truthing of the data for benthic habitat mapping, in concert with various members of the scallop fishing community in Nova Scotia.  This project produced benthic classification and mapping of scallop beds for a more accurate and reliable method of fishing and resource management in scallop productive zones.  The joint venture, commenced in 2000, resulted in the successful acquisition of 5,000 Sq. Km of multibeam bathymetry coverage on the upper Scotian Slope, and Scotian Shelf. In addition, McGregor staff have recently undertaken sophisticated analysis of the multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data from sites on the Scotian Shelf to generate predictive maps of scallop habitat, with a great deal of accuracy using species distribution modeling methods.<br>
<br>
2.	More recently McGregor conducted an extensive multibeam and backscatter survey in Foxe Basin, Nunavut. The survey was commissioned to find and chart a primary and secondary route for large ore ships to transport extracted iron ore from the Baffin Island region.  The survey resulted in the collection, processing and charting of over 10,000 line kilometers of multibeam data in just over 35 days.  In addition to high resolution multibeam bathymetry collection, the project required the collection and interpretation of side scan sonar and subbottom profiles in areas along the routes as well as at several loading dock facilities near the proposed mine site.  In addition to the collection of sonar and seismic data, tide gauges were also deployed and recovered along the route to enable an accurate representation of the depth data on hydrographic charts.  McGregor is currently (June 2011) on site in the Hudson Strait for completion of the multibeam route survey through the south Foxe Basin and Hudson Strait to the confluence of the David Strait.  The R/V Strait Signet will be on site until mid-October 2011 to complete the work.<br>
<br>
3.	Collection of 6000 line Km of multibeam data with backscatter for a large EA regional survey off west Greenland in 2009.  This data was collected in conjunction with subbottom profiles to assist in picking sample locations for benthic mapping.<br>
<br>
High Resolution Seismic and Geo-hazard Surveys <br>
<br>
	McGregor GeoScience has a wealth of experience in the acquisition and interpretation of 2D and 3D seismic for the purpose of geohazard identification.<br>
<br>
	McGregor has conducted 2D seismic surveys on the continental slope offshore Nova Scotia for pre-drilling, hazard evaluation and has also acquired deep-water, multichannel seismic along the Scotian and Newfoundland Slopes for the Geological Survey of Canada. McGregor Geoscience Limited has completed many seabed and subsurface surveys for the petroleum industry; off Eastern Canada, in the Beaufort Sea and internationally at several locations.
