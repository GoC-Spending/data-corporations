                            Our climate is changing, and so is the regulatory system that addresses it. There are new standards for predicting and quantifying air emissions and increased pressure on industry to mitigate its impacts.<br>
<br>
A changing climate also means that people, communities, and infrastructure need to be able to adapt to and be protected from the potential impacts of climate change.<br>
<br>
Whether your project is in the planning, construction, or operating phase, we can help you predict and quantify your emissions to meet regulatory requirements, lessen your environmental footprint, and adapt to the effects of climate change.<br>

                            Our climate is changing, and so is the regulatory system that addresses it. There are new standards for predicting and quantifying air emissions and increased pressure on industry to mitigate its impacts.<br>
<br>
A changing climate also means that people, communities, and infrastructure need to be able to adapt to and be protected from the potential impacts of climate change.<br>
<br>
Whether your project is in the planning, construction, or operating phase, we can help you predict and quantify your emissions to meet regulatory requirements, lessen your environmental footprint, and adapt to the effects of climate change.<br>
