              Nourishing Vata Oil <br>
Nourishing Vata oil is wonderful. I used it after long flights in an oil massage for full body and it brought me right back to the ground. Simply wonderful!<br>

Triphala Plus <br>
I started taking the Triphala plus, to support my elimination, digestion and detoxify.<br>
Never had I expected to get more than that. For years my eyes have been sensitive, burning, itchy, red and very very fatigued.  I have been dependent on lubricating eye drops for the past 6 months.<br>
Well.....three days after I started taking the Triphala plus, every single symptom I have mentioned, has stopped.<br>
I cannot believe the relief I have! My eyes feel normal and rested. They look amazing and bright and I see amazing!<br>
Everyone at work is so happy for me because they have watched me struggle with this for years now.<br>
As it shows, I am energized and thrilled with the results. So much so, that three other people have purchased the Triphala plus to give it a try. <br>
So, thank you so much for a fabulous product! <br>

Triphala Plus<br>
Currently, I purchase your Triphala Plus from Planet Organic in Coquitlam. My husband and I are very pleased with the improvements to our health, since we began using this product. However, we consume 4 bottles a month. Do you retail a larger size bottle of capsules or are open to selling to an individual in bulk. I would love to get our kids taking this product.<br>
<br>
Thank-you for your time,<br>

Diarid<br>
<br>
As a natural health practitioner (German certified), I would like to encourage everyone to try outstanding Ayurvedic product line called Sewanti. <br>
<br>
My personal experience is with her product, Diarid. My child has Type 1 Diabetes and an Ayurvedic practitioner prescribed Diarid for my child. It helps immensely! I have been very, very pleased with the effects: it has been very useful in helping lower his blood sugars, but even more importantly, it has helped even out his overall BG (blood glucose) readings. If you know anything about children with diabetes, you will know that anything that helps regulate BG levels is a gift from God. We have been using Diarid for 2 years with very happy results. <br>
<br>
Padmashri Naturals, Inc, Ms. Toprani&#39;s company, also offers other products which customers have found exceedingly high quality and helpful in their striving towards more optimal health. Stressnil, is one that helps reduce stress, Rheumat is another, which helps with the chronic pain of inflammation in the joints. (I am planning to get that for my mother at Christmas.)<br>
Has helped me and my family so tremendously. I feel that merits speaking up on her company&#39;s behalf. There are so many Americans who have to deal with the debilitating effects of diabetes (as well as stress, and arthritis!) - This product helps. I feel certain that many, many people would benefit,<br>

Stressnil and Nourishing Vata Oil <br>
I met Ms. Toprani at lifestyles in Victoria where she recommended Stressnil product along with the Vata oil.  <br>
I have been taking 2 tabs everyday along with self massage with Vata oil and I believe that I have noticed an improvement with keeping myself calm and helping my body cope with everyday demands and transition.<br>
I really appreciated her warm and compassionate approach at the store (your hand massage was wonderful).    Thank you for your support and helping me continue to remain healthy.  <br>
In appreciation, Laura<br>
Rheumat <br>
My mom is very happy with the RHEUMAT, she really likes it and mainly<br>
it really works for her. I would like to order 2 more bottles and 1 Bottle of DIARD.<br>

	Rheumat  is based upon Ayurvedic principles and helps to detoxify the connective tissue in the joints<br>
and relieves pain, inflammation and swelling. This product works best in earlier cases of arthritis provided the person follows the vata anti-doshic diet and lifestyle. <br>

	Thank you for bringing such fine Classical Ayurveda formulations into Canada and getting it all lined with the Health Canada compliance&#39;s. Our clients/patients have been progressing well with the help of these Sewanti products.<br>
We wish you all the best and look forward to more of Ayurveda products via Sewanti series in coming years. Bests,<br>

	One Ayurvedic product I use at my clinic is Sewantis Triphala Plus, which contains Triphala in addition to Bhumy Amalaki (Phyllanthus niruri) and Yashti Madhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra).  Bhumy Amalaki is a very interesting herb from India that is a relative of Amalaki, both of which are in the Phyllanthus genus.  In this formula, Bhumy Amalaki augments the liver protective properties of Amalaki, adding to Triphalas antioxidant arsenal to scavenge free radicals and correct inflammation.  Yashti madhu, or Licorice root, is another useful herb to boost vitality and reduce inflammation, balancing the effect of the other herbs in the formula.  <br>
In particular, I appreciate Sewantis commitment to only the highest quality GMP-tested products, directly accessing the time honored skill and meticulous craftsmanship of authentic Ayurvedic physicians in India.  In our global economy where manufacturing standards are highly variable, such attention to product sourcing and quality is rare.<br>

I am delighted that I discovered The Sewanti products. I have found that these Ayurvedic herbal combinations have become a great addition to my homeopathic practice as they assist the body in both detoxification and restoration.  These time-honored Ayurvedic herbal combinations have proved to assist in alleviating the signs and symptoms of dis-ease by gently stimulating the bodys innate ability to restore homeostasis. <br>
The Sewanti products are both comprehensive and clinically effective.  The series is easy to navigate and the product descriptions are thorough, allowing the patient to easily understand the purpose of the product as well as the benefits and effects of its use.<br>
Neelam Toprani, founder and owner of Sewanti, is an invaluable resource to practitioner who choose to use the Sewanti Ayurvedic Series in their practice.<br>

              Nourishing Vata Oil <br>
Nourishing Vata oil is wonderful. I used it after long flights in an oil massage for full body and it brought me right back to the ground. Simply wonderful!<br>

Triphala Plus <br>
I started taking the Triphala plus, to support my elimination, digestion and detoxify.<br>
Never had I expected to get more than that. For years my eyes have been sensitive, burning, itchy, red and very very fatigued.  I have been dependent on lubricating eye drops for the past 6 months.<br>
Well.....three days after I started taking the Triphala plus, every single symptom I have mentioned, has stopped.<br>
I cannot believe the relief I have! My eyes feel normal and rested. They look amazing and bright and I see amazing!<br>
Everyone at work is so happy for me because they have watched me struggle with this for years now.<br>
As it shows, I am energized and thrilled with the results. So much so, that three other people have purchased the Triphala plus to give it a try. <br>
So, thank you so much for a fabulous product! <br>

Triphala Plus<br>
Currently, I purchase your Triphala Plus from Planet Organic in Coquitlam. My husband and I are very pleased with the improvements to our health, since we began using this product. However, we consume 4 bottles a month. Do you retail a larger size bottle of capsules or are open to selling to an individual in bulk. I would love to get our kids taking this product.<br>
<br>
Thank-you for your time,<br>

Diarid<br>
<br>
As a natural health practitioner (German certified), I would like to encourage everyone to try outstanding Ayurvedic product line called Sewanti. <br>
<br>
My personal experience is with her product, Diarid. My child has Type 1 Diabetes and an Ayurvedic practitioner prescribed Diarid for my child. It helps immensely! I have been very, very pleased with the effects: it has been very useful in helping lower his blood sugars, but even more importantly, it has helped even out his overall BG (blood glucose) readings. If you know anything about children with diabetes, you will know that anything that helps regulate BG levels is a gift from God. We have been using Diarid for 2 years with very happy results. <br>
<br>
Padmashri Naturals, Inc, Ms. Toprani&#39;s company, also offers other products which customers have found exceedingly high quality and helpful in their striving towards more optimal health. Stressnil, is one that helps reduce stress, Rheumat is another, which helps with the chronic pain of inflammation in the joints. (I am planning to get that for my mother at Christmas.)<br>
Has helped me and my family so tremendously. I feel that merits speaking up on her company&#39;s behalf. There are so many Americans who have to deal with the debilitating effects of diabetes (as well as stress, and arthritis!) - This product helps. I feel certain that many, many people would benefit,<br>

Stressnil and Nourishing Vata Oil <br>
I met Ms. Toprani at lifestyles in Victoria where she recommended Stressnil product along with the Vata oil.  <br>
I have been taking 2 tabs everyday along with self massage with Vata oil and I believe that I have noticed an improvement with keeping myself calm and helping my body cope with everyday demands and transition.<br>
I really appreciated her warm and compassionate approach at the store (your hand massage was wonderful).    Thank you for your support and helping me continue to remain healthy.  <br>
In appreciation, Laura<br>
Rheumat <br>
My mom is very happy with the RHEUMAT, she really likes it and mainly<br>
it really works for her. I would like to order 2 more bottles and 1 Bottle of DIARD.<br>

	Rheumat  is based upon Ayurvedic principles and helps to detoxify the connective tissue in the joints<br>
and relieves pain, inflammation and swelling. This product works best in earlier cases of arthritis provided the person follows the vata anti-doshic diet and lifestyle. <br>

	Thank you for bringing such fine Classical Ayurveda formulations into Canada and getting it all lined with the Health Canada compliance&#39;s. Our clients/patients have been progressing well with the help of these Sewanti products.<br>
We wish you all the best and look forward to more of Ayurveda products via Sewanti series in coming years. Bests,<br>

	One Ayurvedic product I use at my clinic is Sewantis Triphala Plus, which contains Triphala in addition to Bhumy Amalaki (Phyllanthus niruri) and Yashti Madhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra).  Bhumy Amalaki is a very interesting herb from India that is a relative of Amalaki, both of which are in the Phyllanthus genus.  In this formula, Bhumy Amalaki augments the liver protective properties of Amalaki, adding to Triphalas antioxidant arsenal to scavenge free radicals and correct inflammation.  Yashti madhu, or Licorice root, is another useful herb to boost vitality and reduce inflammation, balancing the effect of the other herbs in the formula.  <br>
In particular, I appreciate Sewantis commitment to only the highest quality GMP-tested products, directly accessing the time honored skill and meticulous craftsmanship of authentic Ayurvedic physicians in India.  In our global economy where manufacturing standards are highly variable, such attention to product sourcing and quality is rare.<br>

I am delighted that I discovered The Sewanti products. I have found that these Ayurvedic herbal combinations have become a great addition to my homeopathic practice as they assist the body in both detoxification and restoration.  These time-honored Ayurvedic herbal combinations have proved to assist in alleviating the signs and symptoms of dis-ease by gently stimulating the bodys innate ability to restore homeostasis. <br>
The Sewanti products are both comprehensive and clinically effective.  The series is easy to navigate and the product descriptions are thorough, allowing the patient to easily understand the purpose of the product as well as the benefits and effects of its use.<br>
Neelam Toprani, founder and owner of Sewanti, is an invaluable resource to practitioner who choose to use the Sewanti Ayurvedic Series in their practice.<br>
