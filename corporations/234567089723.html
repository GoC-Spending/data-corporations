                            Toronto College of Technology bridges the gap between basic programming skills and those with profound understanding of its intricacies. This Enterprise Software Solutions suite is targeted at application developers and architects charged with developing applications using the latest technologies. Students are provided with insight into various connectivity options available, and introduced to the design patterns most suitable for use with these technologies.<br>
<br>
The goal of this package courses is to instill the students with a solid understanding of not only the core concepts, but also how all the pieces fit together in complete multi-tier Internet business applications. The tremendous increase of interest in server-side technologies, including J2EE, XML, EJB and Microsoft .NET has shaped these course offerings. Designed for enterprise developers who wish to implement server-side business objects in Java and .NET, the courses address the needs of developers, from those new to Java and .NET and object-oriented programming, to those who need the most advanced training in J2EE and .NET. All these courses emphasize solving real-world problems with the goal of applying solutions right away. <br>
