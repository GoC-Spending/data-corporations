        <br>            Western Alfalfa Milling Co. Ltd. is a world leader in the production of certified organic alfalfa pellets for organic fertilizer, soil amendments, and animal feed. Our fertilizer, Alfalfa Green, will contribute to the lushness of lawns, golf courses, municipal green spaces and landscaping, abundance in vegetable gardens, flower beds, even indoor plants all year round. Use in reclamation projects to increase soil aeration, moisture retention, organic matter, and decompact clay soils to improve re-vegetation success after industrial use. On the remediation side, Alfalfa Green is used to boost microbe levels, facilitating hydrocarbon breakdown through a bioremediation process. Alfalfa Green can also be used for feed for virtually any livestock or poultry ration to enhance yolk colouration and are a great source of bypass protein in ruminant diets.<br>

              Use Alfalfa Green as a soil amendment to breakdown hydrocarbons rather than &#39;dig and dumps&#39;. Rather than bringing in new topsoil and dealing with the associated weed issues, use Alfalfa Green to improve your existing soil to a &#39;&#39;near topsoil&#39;&#39; state.

              Alfalfa Green has been used as a soil amendment by major oil and gas companies as a way to reclaim and remediate their affected soils. On the reclamation side, Alfalfa Green boosts soil organic matter, aeration, and moisture retention capabilities promoting a more productive soil. On the remediation side, Alfalfa Green enhances soil microbe populations, acting as a bioremediation agent for hydrocarbon breakdown. <br>
<br>
Alfalfa Green is also used by municipalities as a certified organic fertilizer product. As a natural option it is used on flowers, sports fields, green spaces, and more. Alfalfa Green works as above to improve your soil structure. This results in a thicker grass with improved root development, which helps to choke out weed development.

<br>
We had applied the Certified Organic Alfalfa Green Pellets on our soccer field and ball diamonds in early spring.<br>
<br>
Over the spring and summer season we witnessed an increase growth and thickness of its turf, especially in the bare areas, such as goal creases on the soccer pitches.   We also noticed a lot less weeds than usual, and as a result we did not spray chemically for weeds this season.<br>
<br>
We applied a second application in late October, and are looking forward to next spring with even a better growth; we are also planning to introduce this product to our playground and park areas as well as our sports fields for 2013.<br>

We use alfalfa pellets as part of our nutrient program for our garlic crops.  The size, shape, and density of the pellets make them very flowable and easy to work with.  There is no hanging up in our applicator.<br>
<br>
I certainly recommend using alfalfa pellets as a natural fertilizer for farmers and market gardeners growing high value crops.<br>

Hello Danielle<br>
<br>
Hope you are enjoying the fall.  Just thought I would forward you this photo of the flower bed at the entrance to Innisfail. <br>
<br>
The summer here was cool and wet and as a result the annual beds were slow to develop. The weather turned hot and dry the end of August and throughout September, and the beds finally matured.   I applied Alfalfa Green twice throughout the season,  to this landscaped area and distributed it by hand.  Once the bed started to mature I noticed one section (indicated with black arrow) exhibited significantly more growth and the flower colour was more intense.  The plants appeared much more vigorous than the other sections.  Obviously, this section received more alfalfa green than the others.  In previous years I was able to achieve growth like this with the synthetic fertilizer I used.  There was no synthetic fertilizer applied, only Alfalfa Green.  All sections of the bed have the same soil, and received the same level of care.  I am very excited to achieve results like this with a natural product.<br>

Danielle, attached the photos of the flowers this past summer. All flower<br>
pots, beds and baskets were amended with the Alfalfa Green before planting<br>
and the results were amazing as you can see.  I would recommend the product<br>
to anyone, the Parks Department received numerous complements from our<br>
residents about how wonderful our plantings looked.  The plants were strong<br>
and healthy and lasted well into October before being removed for the<br>
season.<br>

Please find below a testimonial for Alfalfa Green Fertilizer during the 2012 season.<br>
<br>
We have been test trialing Alfalfa Green Fertilizer as a topdressing material to help combat compaction in our parks.  We have observed that the area containing Alfalfa Green is less compact than the control plot.  This product was compatible with our equipment and easy to apply.  The pellets blended well with the turfgrass and were completely broken down within 14 days after applying.  So far, we have seen desirable results and we will continue to test this product in the future.      <br>

&quot;This is the first year that I used Alfalfa Green pellets on a trial basis in my garden. I used it mainly for tomatoes, cabbage, peas, onions, zucchinis and hanging pots. The results were amazing! The plants grew bigger, had darker green leaves and produced much more and larger vegetables. I plan to expand the use of Alfalfa Green in my garden next year. Alfalfa Green is safe for the environment and there is no chance of burning from overuse of this slow release fertilizer and soil nutrient. I highly recommend to gardeners to use Alfalfa Green in your yard and garden.&quot;<br>

Danielle: During the past 3 years the Town of Morden, Community Services Department has been using your Alfalfa pellets in our flower beds and sports grounds. We have found the flowers and grounds have greatly improve in growth since we started using your product. The staff has also taken it home for their gardens and say the Tomatoes are the best they have ever had. Our ground grass will increase in growth once we start to aerate the ground. Thanks for your product which we will be continuing to use in the town.<br>

 <br>
    Shortly after taking over the Greenhouse in 2005 we were introduced to Alfalfa Green and trialed it on some of our container Rose Bushes with positive results.  The following season we started using Alfalfa Green as an additive to our growing medium for our transplants.  It has now become our primary fertilizer and has allowed us to cut back on both slow release fertilizers and the amount of water soluble fertilizers applied through our injector system.<br>
    We strongly feel that our use of Alfalfa Green has allowed us to grow a superior product and the fact that it is an environmentally friendly product is a positive bonus.  We also use Alfalfa Green extensively in our Market Garden operation, again with positive results.  Our retail sales of Alfalfa Green has also increased with many of our customers coming back for a bag of that special fertilizer which they bought last year.<br>

Testimonial by Barb Holmes<br>

City of Fort Saskatchewan,  Alberta<br>
<br>
In July 2009 the City of Fort Saskatchewan purchased certified organic Alfalfa Green manufactured by Western Alfalfa Milling Co. Ltd. (WAMCO). We bought the product primarily for use on our sports fields.<br>
<br>
The pellets were applied in late July. The Alfalfa Green was easy to spread and convenient as we did not have to worry about over applying. As well, its nice that it is an organic product rather than being a synthetic chemical. <br>
<br>
We found the results satisfactory and therefore in the spring of 2010 we purchased more Alfalfa Green. We used it on all of our 29 sports fields in June 2010. As we were once again pleased with the results on our sports fields, we will again be using Alfalfa Green on our sports fields as well as trying it on some of our flower beds and pots in 2011. <br>

Testimonial by Shannon Wanner, Urban Forestry/Green Space Technician for the City of Estevan, Saskatchewan<br>
<br>
In April 2010 the City of Estevan purchased certified organic Alfalfa Green manufactured by Western Alfalfa Milling Co. Ltd. (WAMCO). We bought the product primarily for use in flower pots throughout the city.<br>
<br>
In an average year the City of Estevan plants approximately 10 000 flowers in flower beds and pots. This year I was looking for a more convenient organic fertilizer option. I went with Alfalfa Green and applied it to our flower beds and pots at a rate of one cup per foot of weep line circumference. The pellets were applied in early May at time of planting and were re-applied one month later in June and again in July. The Alfalfa Green was easy to handle and apply and was more convenient than some inorganic fertilizers Ive previously used which had to be mixed with water prior to applying. Most importantly, I have peace of mind knowing that these organic pellets do not pose a health threat to Estevans citizens, children, or pets as they walk through our parks; nor have they been detrimental to the health of any of my staff members who applied them.<br>
<br>
In July I observed that the flowers seem to be doing better than in previous years. The blooms, leaves, and foliage appear larger and the colouring perhaps a bit deeper and more vibrant than normal. The only change to our program this year is the addition of WAMCOs Alfalfa Green fertilizer. <br>
<br>
Overall I like Alfalfa Green and will use it again in our flower program next year. <br>
<br>

              Alfalfa Green has been used as a soil amendment by major oil and gas companies as a way to reclaim and remediate their affected soils. On the reclamation side, Alfalfa Green boosts soil organic matter, aeration, and moisture retention capabilities promoting a more productive soil. On the remediation side, Alfalfa Green enhances soil microbe populations, acting as a bioremediation agent for hydrocarbon breakdown. <br>
<br>
Alfalfa Green is also used by municipalities as a certified organic fertilizer product. As a natural option it is used on flowers, sports fields, green spaces, and more. Alfalfa Green works as above to improve your soil structure. This results in a thicker grass with improved root development, which helps to choke out weed development.

We had applied the Certified Organic Alfalfa Green Pellets on our soccer field and ball diamonds in early spring.<br>
<br>
Over the spring and summer season we witnessed an increase growth and thickness of its turf, especially in the bare areas, such as goal creases on the soccer pitches.   We also noticed a lot less weeds than usual, and as a result we did not spray chemically for weeds this season.<br>
<br>
We applied a second application in late October, and are looking forward to next spring with even a better growth; we are also planning to introduce this product to our playground and park areas as well as our sports fields for 2013.<br>

We use alfalfa pellets as part of our nutrient program for our garlic crops.  The size, shape, and density of the pellets make them very flowable and easy to work with.  There is no hanging up in our applicator.<br>
<br>
I certainly recommend using alfalfa pellets as a natural fertilizer for farmers and market gardeners growing high value crops.<br>

Hello Danielle<br>
<br>
Hope you are enjoying the fall.  Just thought I would forward you this photo of the flower bed at the entrance to Innisfail. <br>
<br>
The summer here was cool and wet and as a result the annual beds were slow to develop. The weather turned hot and dry the end of August and throughout September, and the beds finally matured.   I applied Alfalfa Green twice throughout the season,  to this landscaped area and distributed it by hand.  Once the bed started to mature I noticed one section (indicated with black arrow) exhibited significantly more growth and the flower colour was more intense.  The plants appeared much more vigorous than the other sections.  Obviously, this section received more alfalfa green than the others.  In previous years I was able to achieve growth like this with the synthetic fertilizer I used.  There was no synthetic fertilizer applied, only Alfalfa Green.  All sections of the bed have the same soil, and received the same level of care.  I am very excited to achieve results like this with a natural product.<br>

Danielle, attached the photos of the flowers this past summer. All flower<br>
pots, beds and baskets were amended with the Alfalfa Green before planting<br>
and the results were amazing as you can see.  I would recommend the product<br>
to anyone, the Parks Department received numerous complements from our<br>
residents about how wonderful our plantings looked.  The plants were strong<br>
and healthy and lasted well into October before being removed for the<br>
season.<br>

Please find below a testimonial for Alfalfa Green Fertilizer during the 2012 season.<br>
<br>
We have been test trialing Alfalfa Green Fertilizer as a topdressing material to help combat compaction in our parks.  We have observed that the area containing Alfalfa Green is less compact than the control plot.  This product was compatible with our equipment and easy to apply.  The pellets blended well with the turfgrass and were completely broken down within 14 days after applying.  So far, we have seen desirable results and we will continue to test this product in the future.      <br>

&quot;This is the first year that I used Alfalfa Green pellets on a trial basis in my garden. I used it mainly for tomatoes, cabbage, peas, onions, zucchinis and hanging pots. The results were amazing! The plants grew bigger, had darker green leaves and produced much more and larger vegetables. I plan to expand the use of Alfalfa Green in my garden next year. Alfalfa Green is safe for the environment and there is no chance of burning from overuse of this slow release fertilizer and soil nutrient. I highly recommend to gardeners to use Alfalfa Green in your yard and garden.&quot;<br>

Danielle: During the past 3 years the Town of Morden, Community Services Department has been using your Alfalfa pellets in our flower beds and sports grounds. We have found the flowers and grounds have greatly improve in growth since we started using your product. The staff has also taken it home for their gardens and say the Tomatoes are the best they have ever had. Our ground grass will increase in growth once we start to aerate the ground. Thanks for your product which we will be continuing to use in the town.<br>

PRODUCT ENDORSEMENT<br>
 <br>
    Shortly after taking over the Greenhouse in 2005 we were introduced to Alfalfa Green and trialed it on some of our container Rose Bushes with positive results.  The following season we started using Alfalfa Green as an additive to our growing medium for our transplants.  It has now become our primary fertilizer and has allowed us to cut back on both slow release fertilizers and the amount of water soluble fertilizers applied through our injector system.<br>
    We strongly feel that our use of Alfalfa Green has allowed us to grow a superior product and the fact that it is an environmentally friendly product is a positive bonus.  We also use Alfalfa Green extensively in our Market Garden operation, again with positive results.  Our retail sales of Alfalfa Green has also increased with many of our customers coming back for a bag of that special fertilizer which they bought last year.<br>

Testimonial by Barb Holmes<br>

City of Fort Saskatchewan,  Alberta<br>
<br>
In July 2009 the City of Fort Saskatchewan purchased certified organic Alfalfa Green manufactured by Western Alfalfa Milling Co. Ltd. (WAMCO). We bought the product primarily for use on our sports fields.<br>
<br>
The pellets were applied in late July. The Alfalfa Green was easy to spread and convenient as we did not have to worry about over applying. As well, its nice that it is an organic product rather than being a synthetic chemical. <br>
<br>
We found the results satisfactory and therefore in the spring of 2010 we purchased more Alfalfa Green. We used it on all of our 29 sports fields in June 2010. As we were once again pleased with the results on our sports fields, we will again be using Alfalfa Green on our sports fields as well as trying it on some of our flower beds and pots in 2011. <br>

Testimonial by Shannon Wanner, Urban Forestry/Green Space Technician for the City of Estevan, Saskatchewan<br>
<br>
In April 2010 the City of Estevan purchased certified organic Alfalfa Green manufactured by Western Alfalfa Milling Co. Ltd. (WAMCO). We bought the product primarily for use in flower pots throughout the city.<br>
<br>
In an average year the City of Estevan plants approximately 10 000 flowers in flower beds and pots. This year I was looking for a more convenient organic fertilizer option. I went with Alfalfa Green and applied it to our flower beds and pots at a rate of one cup per foot of weep line circumference. The pellets were applied in early May at time of planting and were re-applied one month later in June and again in July. The Alfalfa Green was easy to handle and apply and was more convenient than some inorganic fertilizers Ive previously used which had to be mixed with water prior to applying. Most importantly, I have peace of mind knowing that these organic pellets do not pose a health threat to Estevans citizens, children, or pets as they walk through our parks; nor have they been detrimental to the health of any of my staff members who applied them.<br>
<br>
In July I observed that the flowers seem to be doing better than in previous years. The blooms, leaves, and foliage appear larger and the colouring perhaps a bit deeper and more vibrant than normal. The only change to our program this year is the addition of WAMCOs Alfalfa Green fertilizer. <br>
<br>
Overall I like Alfalfa Green and will use it again in our flower program next year. <br>
<br>
