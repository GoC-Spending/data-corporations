        <br>            Tactical Technologies Inc. (TTI) provides training, analytical products and services that focus on electronic countermeasure development and support as required by military platforms for self protection. TTIs software products are marketed under the trade name Tactical Engagement Simulation Software (TESS).<br><br>TESS supports weapon system modeling, tactical engagement simulation, engagement analysis and countermeasure effectiveness evaluations in some of the most advanced EW laboratories in over 20 countries. TESS is used by weapon system designers, engineers, researchers and the military to support their analytical, test and evaluation and training requirements in electronic countermeasures.<br><br>TESS utilizes high fidelity open-source weapon system models to capture system dynamics and non-linear behaviour. User inputs characterize the system models to behave like specific weapon systems. These weapon system models can be used independently as stand-alone models, or, as an integrated engagement simulation where a user can define a target, threat and the environment in between and run engagement simulations. This allows the user to monitor, analyze and evaluate the interactions with other systems.<br><br>TESS simulators support anti-ship, anti-tank surface-to-air and air-to-air engagements with radar or infrared guided weapons. In these simulations a threat system or systems engage a target platform with user defined self protection capabilities. The simulations support dynamic engagement geometries, conditions, signal environments and tactics that include platform manoeuvring, and the controlled activation of various countermeasure tactics and techniques. TESS simulations generate miss distance and probability of survival metrics for effectiveness evaluations. The TESS Master Interface provides a database for the users threat, target and system libraries and a simulation execution manager for Monte Carlo and/or deterministic batch simulations.<br><br>TESS is commercial-off-the-shelf software that runs on a standard PC with Windows, MATLAB &amp; Simulink. Available with source code and detailed software documentation TESS support custom development by the user.

                            SAAM(IR)  is an integrated engagement simulation between one or two passive infrared homing surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles and a target aircraft. The aircraft can use up to four manoeuvres in azimuth and/or elevation to defend itself along with infrared flares, an on-board infrared jammer (Omni-directional or DIRCM) and a towed IR decoy. The target aircraft can be fixed or rotary winged and configured with 1, 2 or 4 engines. The infrared aircraft signatures are user entered radiant intensity profiles for each source based on wavelength and aspect angle. The missiles infrared homing seeker model supports generations 1, 2 and 3 with spin scan, conscan, rosette and four-detector array angle tracking and spiral and rosette search techniques. The missile seeker also includes selectable one or two color discrimination and missile guidance is by proportional navigation autopilot. The propagation environment includes user-defined IR attenuation characteristics and background radiant intensity signature. The IR jammer employs swept amplitude modulation techniques. All electronic countermeasures can be employed individually or in combination against all search, acquisition and track modes of the missile seeker.<br>

                            ASM(IR) - is an integrated engagement simulation between an anti-ship heat-seeking missile and a ship. As a soft-kill defence, the ship may deploy up to four infrared decoys (two seduction and two distraction decoys).  The seduction decoy can dispense up to six sub-munitions before its final payload to achieve a &quot;walk-off&quot; effect.  The decoy cartridge trajectory can be computed using equations of motion or based on a lookup table profile. A user-defined number of fixed decoy launchers may be positioned anywhere on the ship. The ship features a user-selectable automatic evasive manoeuvre which is triggered at missile seeker turn-on. The missile uses proportional navigation guidance, can be characterized with either a bank- or skid-to-turn airframe and includes a dual-band imaging seeker for target detection.  The infrared signature of the ship and the decoys are specified in detail with the TESS IR Profiler included in the product. The propagation environment includes user-enterable IR attenuation characteristics and background, sea and atmospheric radiant intensity signatures.<br>

                            ASM(AR)  is an integrated engagement simulation between one or two anti-ship missiles with active radar homing and a target ship. The ship can employ active on-board jamming and may deploy up to six passive decoys. Each passive decoy can be chaff, single corner reflector or dual corner reflector. The ship can also deploy two active decoys. Each active decoy can be either suspended or hovering and each has noise, pulse repeater and RGPO jamming capability. The ships active jammer allows simulation of cross-eye, cross polarization, swept AM with swept duty cycle, range-gate pull-off (RGPO) and CW noise. The ship also features a user selectable automatic evasive manoeuvre which is triggered at missile seeker turn-on. The decoy launcher is repositionable, can be fixed or trainable and supports both rocket and mortar launched decoys. The missile uses proportional navigation guidance, can be characterized with either a bank or skid-to-turn airframe and includes a seeker with search, acquisition, track and home-on-jam modes. The missile ECCMs include: stiff neck and target height, glint and scintillation discrimination. The ships electronic countermeasures can be applied, individually or in combinations, against the missile seeker.<br>

The jammer is also capable of running swept amplitude modulation, cross-eye, cross-polarization, frequency modulation and noise jamming programs. The electronic countermeasures can be applied individually or in combinations against the TTR and/or the missiles seeker in their search, acquisition and tracking modes. The missile guidance is provided by a proportional navigation autopilot. The missile system includes a coherent pulse Doppler or FM-CW target tracking radar, a coherent CW target illumination radar, and a missile with a CW Doppler homing seeker.<br>

                            SAM(CG)/AAA  is an integrated engagement simulation between one or two radar controlled anti-aircraft guns or command guided surface-to-air missiles and a target aircraft. The aircraft can use up to four manoeuvres in azimuth and/or elevation to defend itself along with chaff, active noise and/or repeater towed decoys and an on-board jammer. The jammer is capable of running user-defined range deception programs with up to three pulse trains simultaneously each for range gate pull-off and the generation of false targets. The jammer is also capable of running swept amplitude modulation, cross-eye, cross-polarization, frequency modulation and noise jamming programs. The SAM(CG)/AAA target tracking radar is a non-coherent pulse radar. The electronic countermeasures can be applied, individually or in user-defined combinations against the TTRs search, acquisition and tracking modes. The simulations missile tracking radar (MTR) and command guidance link operate ideally and are unaffected by the targets countermeasures. The command guided missile control system uses proportional navigation guidance while the anti-aircraft gun uses a collision point estimation processor.<br>

                            MSR  is an integrated engagement simulation in which a pulsed, or pulse Doppler surveillance radar on a stationary platform observes an aircraft with electronic countermeasures doing a fly-by. The user, a radar operator, can observe the aircraft with a plan position indicator (PPI) and an A-Scope as it generates deceptive signals and deploys countermeasures. The radar operator has control of various ECCMs such as CFAR, scope intensity and persistence. The aircraft flight profile can include up to 4 manoeuvres in azimuth and elevation and the aircrafts countermeasures include chaff active decoys with noise and/or pulse repeater capability and an on-board DRFM-based jammer. The on-board jammer is capable of running a user-defined multi-target range deception program, false targets, as well as support Doppler noise, swept amplitude modulation, cross-eye, cross-polarization and frequency modulation jamming programs. These countermeasure techniques can be applied individually or in user-defined combinations.<br>

                            IASMD - is an integrated engagement simulation between one or two anti-ship missiles and a ship equipped with both soft-kill and hard-kill weapon systems. The ships soft-kill assets include chaff, active decoys (CW noise and pulse repeater) and an on-board jammer. An ESM system provides threat system detection and identification to the threat evaluation and weapon assignment (TEWA) system in the combat information centre (CIC) that in turn controls the ships defensive assets. The ships hard-kill assets including semi-active anti-missile missiles and a close-in weapons system (CIWS) are managed under control of the CIC system and activated based on user-defined engagement criteria. The on-board jammer includes user selectable jamming techniques and parameters, including range gate pull off, swept amplitude modulation, swept duty cycle, cross-eye, cross-polarization and noise. Both seduction and distraction chaff can be simulated. ECM techniques can be applied individually or in combinations, against the search, acquisition, tracking and home-on-jam modes of the attacking missile seeker. The anti-ship missiles use proportional navigation guidance and include a seeker with search, acquisition, track and home-on-jam modes. The seeker also includes user selectable ECCMs of leading/trailing edge track selection and chaff rejection discrimination. The ships semi-active anti-missile missiles use a coherent pulse Doppler target tracking radar, a coherent ICW target illumination radar and a missile with an ICW Doppler homing seeker and a proportional navigation autopilot. The CIWS uses a coherent pulse Doppler fire control radar.<br>

                            ILAPS is an integrated engagement simulation between a semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) anti-tank missile, or rocket propelled grenade and a tank equipped with an active protection system with both soft-kill and hard-kill countermeasures. The tanks soft kill assets include obscurants and an IR hot-spot jammer. The tanks hard-kill asset is a trainable launcher with suitable munitions. Staring radar and infrared arrays on the tank detect and track incoming threats and the fire-control computer assesses the scenario and reacts as appropriate with countermeasures. The threat has both a radar cross section as well as a radiance intensity signature for the radar and IR sensors. ILAPS uses an imaging tracker to emulate the operator and a missile beacon tracker to follow the missile and steer it towards the target. In RPG engagements the guidance is disabled and the RPG must be fired with the appropriate elevation and lead angle. The infrared signature of the tank is specified in detail with the TESS IR Profiler included in the product. Since ILAPS was designed to support active protection system development, there are actually 2 staring array radar systems (1 pulse Doppler and 1 FMCW), 2 fire-control computers and 2 launchers so that the soft-kill and hard-kill countermeasure systems can be developed and tested independently.<br>

            TTI has developed both a structured engineering analysis methodology and develops a set of high fidelity modeling and simulation based technology tools to support the test and evaluation of electronic countermeasures used in military platform self-protection.<br>
<br>
These solutions address analytical requirements in the virtual domain as well as real-time test and evaluation of hardware-in-the-loop. TTI also supports the training of electronic warfare operational support staff and real-time interactive operator training with this technology.<br>
<br>
TTI focuses on radar, infrared, electro-optically guided and unguided weapons (RPGs) in surface-to-air, air-to-air, anti-ship and anti-tank engagements with various classes of aircraft, ships and other platforms equipped with countermeasure capabilities. These countermeasures may be soft-kill, hard-kill or both depending on the customers application interests. (Please review the wide range of capabilities offered by TTIs standard TESS products that range from surface-to-air missiles to active protection systems).<br>
<br>
TTIs technology is physics based and therefore supports first principles based research into the interaction between weapon systems under a broad range of simulated engagement conditions, and allows the user to develop statistical insight into what will happen when and why...<br>
<br>
TTI offers a range of commercial off-the-shelf integrated engagement simulation products under the trade name of Tactical Engagement Simulation Software (TESS) as well as custom modeling and simulation design, development and support services that include third party analytical services.<br>

                            SAAM(IR)  is an integrated engagement simulation between one or two passive infrared homing surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles and a target aircraft. The aircraft can use up to four manoeuvres in azimuth and/or elevation to defend itself along with infrared flares, an on-board infrared jammer (Omni-directional or DIRCM) and a towed IR decoy. The target aircraft can be fixed or rotary winged and configured with 1, 2 or 4 engines. The infrared aircraft signatures are user entered radiant intensity profiles for each source based on wavelength and aspect angle. The missiles infrared homing seeker model supports generations 1, 2 and 3 with spin scan, conscan, rosette and four-detector array angle tracking and spiral and rosette search techniques. The missile seeker also includes selectable one or two color discrimination and missile guidance is by proportional navigation autopilot. The propagation environment includes user-defined IR attenuation characteristics and background radiant intensity signature. The IR jammer employs swept amplitude modulation techniques. All electronic countermeasures can be employed individually or in combination against all search, acquisition and track modes of the missile seeker.<br>

                            ASM(IR) - is an integrated engagement simulation between an anti-ship heat-seeking missile and a ship. As a soft-kill defence, the ship may deploy up to four infrared decoys (two seduction and two distraction decoys).  The seduction decoy can dispense up to six sub-munitions before its final payload to achieve a &quot;walk-off&quot; effect.  The decoy cartridge trajectory can be computed using equations of motion or based on a lookup table profile. A user-defined number of fixed decoy launchers may be positioned anywhere on the ship. The ship features a user-selectable automatic evasive manoeuvre which is triggered at missile seeker turn-on. The missile uses proportional navigation guidance, can be characterized with either a bank- or skid-to-turn airframe and includes a dual-band imaging seeker for target detection.  The infrared signature of the ship and the decoys are specified in detail with the TESS IR Profiler included in the product.

                            ASM(AR)  is an integrated engagement simulation between one or two anti-ship missiles with active radar homing and a target ship. The ship can employ active on-board jamming and may deploy up to six passive decoys. Each passive decoy can be chaff, single corner reflector or dual corner reflector. The ship can also deploy two active decoys. Each active decoy can be either suspended or hovering and each has noise, pulse repeater and RGPO jamming capability. The ships active jammer allows simulation of cross-eye, cross polarization, swept AM with swept duty cycle, range-gate pull-off (RGPO) and CW noise. The ship also features a user selectable automatic evasive manoeuvre which is triggered at missile seeker turn-on. The decoy launcher is repositionable, can be fixed or trainable and supports both rocket and mortar launched decoys. The missile uses proportional navigation guidance, can be characterized with either a bank or skid-to-turn airframe and includes a seeker with search, acquisition, track and home-on-jam modes. The missile ECCMs include: stiff neck and target height, glint and scintillation discrimination. The ships electronic countermeasures can be applied, individually or in combinations, against the missile seeker.<br>

                            MSR  is an integrated engagement simulation in which a pulsed, or pulse Doppler surveillance radar on a stationary platform observes an aircraft with electronic countermeasures doing a fly-by. The user, a radar operator, can observe the aircraft with a plan position indicator (PPI) and an A-Scope as it generates deceptive signals and deploys countermeasures. The radar operator has control of various ECCMs such as CFAR, scope intensity and persistence. The aircraft flight profile can include up to 4 manoeuvres in azimuth and elevation and the aircrafts countermeasures include chaff active decoys with noise and/or pulse repeater capability and an on-board DRFM-based jammer. The on-board jammer is capable of running a user-defined multi-target range deception program, false targets, as well as support Doppler noise, swept amplitude modulation, cross-eye, cross-polarization and frequency modulation jamming programs. These countermeasure techniques can be applied individually or in user-defined combinations.<br>

                            IASMD - is an integrated engagement simulation between one or two anti-ship missiles and a ship equipped with both soft-kill and hard-kill weapon systems. The ships soft-kill assets include chaff, active decoys (CW noise and pulse repeater) and an on-board jammer. An ESM system provides threat system detection and identification to the threat evaluation and weapon assignment (TEWA) system in the combat information centre (CIC) that in turn controls the ships defensive assets. The ships hard-kill assets including semi-active anti-missile missiles and a close-in weapons system (CIWS) are managed under control of the CIC system and activated based on user-defined engagement criteria. The on-board jammer includes user selectable jamming techniques and parameters, including range gate pull off, swept amplitude modulation, swept duty cycle, cross-eye, cross-polarization and noise. Both seduction and distraction chaff can be simulated. ECM techniques can be applied individually or in combinations, against the search, acquisition, tracking and home-on-jam modes of the attacking missile seeker. The anti-ship missiles use proportional navigation guidance and include a seeker with search, acquisition, track and home-on-jam modes. The seeker also includes user selectable ECCMs of leading/trailing edge track selection and chaff rejection discrimination. The ships semi-active anti-missile missiles use a coherent pulse Doppler target tracking radar, a coherent ICW target illumination radar and a missile with an ICW Doppler homing seeker and a proportional navigation autopilot. The CIWS uses a coherent pulse Doppler fire control radar.<br>

                            ILAPS is an integrated engagement simulation between a semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) anti-tank missile, or rocket propelled grenade and a tank equipped with an active protection system with both soft-kill and hard-kill countermeasures. The tanks soft kill assets include obscurants and an IR hot-spot jammer. The tanks hard-kill asset is a trainable launcher with suitable munitions. Staring radar and infrared arrays on the tank detect and track incoming threats and the fire-control computer assesses the scenario and reacts as appropriate with countermeasures. The threat has both a radar cross section as well as a radiance intensity signature for the radar and IR sensors. ILAPS uses an imaging tracker to emulate the operator and a missile beacon tracker to follow the missile and steer it towards the target. In RPG engagements the guidance is disabled and the RPG must be fired with the appropriate elevation and lead angle. The infrared signature of the tank is specified in detail with the TESS IR Profiler included in the product. Since ILAPS was designed to support active protection system development, there are actually 2 staring array radar systems (1 pulse Doppler and 1 FMCW), 2 fire-control computers and 2 launchers so that the soft-kill and hard-kill countermeasure systems can be developed and tested independently.<br>

            TTI has developed both a structured engineering analysis methodology and develops a set of high fidelity modeling and simulation based technology tools to support the test and evaluation of electronic countermeasures used in military platform self-protection.<br>
<br>
These solutions address analytical requirements in the virtual domain as well as real-time test and evaluation of hardware-in-the-loop. TTI also supports the training of electronic warfare operational support staff and real-time interactive operator training with this technology.<br>
<br>
TTI focuses on radar, infrared, electro-optically guided and unguided weapons (RPGs) in surface-to-air, air-to-air, anti-ship and anti-tank engagements with various classes of aircraft, ships and other platforms equipped with countermeasure capabilities. These countermeasures may be soft-kill, hard-kill or both depending on the customers application interests. (Please review the wide range of capabilities offered by TTIs standard TESS products that range from surface-to-air missiles to active protection systems).<br>
<br>
TTIs technology is physics based and therefore supports first principles based research into the interaction between weapon systems under a broad range of simulated engagement conditions, and allows the user to develop statistical insight into what will happen when and why...<br>
<br>
TTI offers a range of commercial off-the-shelf integrated engagement simulation products under the trade name of Tactical Engagement Simulation Software (TESS) as well as custom modeling and simulation design, development and support services that include third party analytical services.<br>

These potential partners need to have some techical expertise in the countermeasures domain.
