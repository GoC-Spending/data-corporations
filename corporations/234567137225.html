                            The Wave Point Consulting logistics and supply chain practice is focused on getting the right product, to the right market, in the right condition, at the right time. Shippers, carriers and terminal operators are all adapting to the impacts of shifts in economic fundamentals. Rapid change in currency values, capital market fluctuations, volatility in fuel and commodity prices, the uncertain pace of consumer demand and new environmental initiatives are all having a dramatic impact on logistics and supply chain practices.  We assist firms seeking to achieve cost reduction targets, access new markets, support increases sales activity, or enhance the environmental, or operating performance of existing assets.<br>
<br>
For small and medium enterprises without full-time logistics or traffic departments, companies that are rapidly expanding, or simply dont have the time and resources to deal with crucial logistics functions, the Wave Point Consulting team is an ideal fit.

                            The Wave Point Consulting transportation practice is focused on helping firms, communities and governments adapt to shifting world trade patterns, changing customer requirements, relentless business pressure and sustainability expectations. Uncertainty is a major factor facing transportation clients, and shippers that rely on their surface transport providers. Rapid change in currency values, capital market outlook, volatility in fuel and commodity prices, technology and new environmental initiatives are all having a dramatic impact.<br>
<br>
As multimodal transportation experts, we help port authorities, importers, exports, carriers and terminal operators and governments take informed actions to assess the commercial impacts of these changes, improve operational performance and determine infrastructure requirements. Team members with deep industry experience deliver well researched, expertly considered intelligence and advice through the provision of the following services:<br>
<br>
- Acquisitions &amp; Merger Due Diligence,<br>
- Cruise Tourism Development,<br>
- Economic Impact Assessments,<br>
- Freight &amp; Goods Movement Analysis,<br>
- Shipping &amp; Environmental Regulatory Law,<br>
- Transportation Socioeconomic Studies.<br>
<br>
For firms to be successful, making the best transportation decisions is extremely important. Our aim is to help small cap firms and governments make the right choices for their organization.<br>

                            The Wave Point Consulting infrastructure development practice is focused on securing both short and long-term client value-creating opportunities. Quality revenue generation, new market access, improved sustainability, and community acceptance of transportation infrastructure (and associated commercial real estate opportunities) are all important factors that influence the nature of the social license required for business investment. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals can result in significantly increased costs, or a competitor securing a stronger position in the marketplace. The nuances of the Canadian federal and provincial regulatory approval process, transportation legislation, tight time frames and the rigour required for project approval can be a challenge for both executives and technical personnel working on infrastructure development projects. To overcome these challenges our team members can assist project proponents with:<br>
<br>
- Community Consultations,<br>
- Employment Land Studies,<br>
- Project Environmental Assessment Process Management,<br>
- Regulatory Strategy,<br>
- Site Selection &amp; Market Access Evaluation,<br>
- Transportation Master Planning Land Use Analysis.<br>

Wave Point Consulting has provided a number of services. Most recently, they developed a &quot;National Accommodations Strategy (NAS), which was a national masterplan for planning, acquisition, life-cycle management, and maintenance for our portfolio across the country. The NAS has been recognized both within government and by the Real Property Institute of Canada as a &quot;best practice&quot; and has resulted in Health Canada reducing it&#39;s real estate costs by over $65 Million Dollars to date. These savings are projected to increase to approximately $100 Million as the strategy is fully implemented. Their professional services were very much appreciated, and highly valued. Wave Point is highly recommended.<br>

                            The Wave Point Consulting transportation practice is focused on helping firms, communities and governments adapt to shifting world trade patterns, changing customer requirements, relentless business pressure and sustainability expectations. Uncertainty is a major factor facing transportation clients, and shippers that rely on their surface transport providers. Rapid change in currency values, capital market outlook, volatility in fuel and commodity prices, technology and new environmental initiatives are all having a dramatic impact.<br>

                            The Wave Point Consulting infrastructure development practice is focused on securing both short and long-term client value-creating opportunities. Quality revenue generation, new market access, improved sustainability, and community acceptance of transportation infrastructure (and associated commercial real estate opportunities) are all important factors that influence the nature of the social license required for business investment. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals can result in significantly increased costs, or a competitor securing a stronger position in the marketplace. The nuances of the Canadian federal and provincial regulatory approval process, transportation legislation, tight time frames and the rigour required for project approval can be a challenge for both executives and technical personnel working on infrastructure development projects. To overcome these challenges our team members can assist project proponents with:<br>
<br>
- Community Consultations,<br>
- Employment Land Studies,<br>
- Project Environmental Assessment Process Management,<br>
- Regulatory Strategy,<br>
- Site Selection &amp; Market Access Evaluation,<br>
- Transportation Master Planning Land Use Analysis.<br>
<br>
To assure optimal investment and operating decisions work with our team members. <br>

Wave Point Consulting has provided a number of services. Most recently, they developed a &quot;National Accommodations Strategy (NAS), which was a national masterplan for planning, acquisition, life-cycle management, and maintenance for our portfolio across the country. The NAS has been recognized both within government and by the Real Property Institute of Canada as a &quot;best practice&quot; and has resulted in Health Canada reducing it&#39;s real estate costs by over $65 Million Dollars to date. These savings are projected to increase to approximately $100 Million as the strategy is fully implemented. Their professional services were very much appreciated, and highly valued. Wave Point is highly recommended.<br>
