We have delivered custom solutions to many different industries including Oil &amp; Gas,<br>Government, Law/Legal, Retail, Aviation, and Education just to name a few. Our solutions range from marketing websites that generate brand exposure, leads and sales, to mobile apps and large-scale websites that run entire companies.<br>

                            Our CMS experts work with systems like Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla (to name a few) that provide our customers with the simple, secure, and reliable CMS platform they need. We have seen custom CMS platforms come and go over the years and recommend using a well-known CMS like the platforms mentioned above. This is because most custom CMS platforms have a limited shelf-life or the provider disappears; leaving you with the painful task of migrating to a better supported platform. Why take the risk?

              Our Company has worked with Oracast on a couple of projects over the past 2<br>
years, where they have built us a system, specifically designed to meet the<br>
needs of our business. They have done an excellent job of understanding our<br>
needs, and have been creative in the solutions to the problems that we faced.<br>
The system that they built has raised our company&#39;s level of efficiency in the<br>
office and in the field. Oracast has continued to provide quick support when<br>

relationship with Oracast, and look forward to continuing to use their expertise in<br>
the future. - Melbern Vegetation Inc.<br>

later I was no closer to launching than I was when we started. In desperation I<br>
reached out to Oracast. Most assuredly one of my better decisions. Jes, Ryan and their team were phenomenal. Unfortunately, the program had originally been<br>
created in an outdated platform making future upgrades basically impossible.<br>
The solutions was to start from basically scratch and rewrite the entire code in<br>
PHP which would save money in the long run. Oracast stuck to their original<br>
quote without complaint even though the task had become much, MUCH larger.<br>
The end result is a web application that is exponentially better than what I had<br>
hoped for and allows for substantial growth and flexibility going forward. Ryan<br>
spent literally DAYS on the phone with me, evenings and weekends included, to<br>
ensure that the application was everything I required and more. I was made to<br>
feel like a big fish in a little pond even though this was the opposite of reality.<br>
This group will be my &#39;go to&#39; company permanently and I highly recommend them<br>
for whatever your requirements are. I cannot say enough great things about this<br>
company. Great people + great product = 100% lifelong customer loyalty! Do<br>
yourself a favour and hire them! You won&#39;t be disappointed. - Carwise Consulting Inc.<br>

Prior to working with us, many of our customers managed their operations using spreadsheets and others were still manual. Today, they can&#39;t imagine doing business without their custom web application.<br>

                            Our CMS experts work with systems like Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla (to name a few) that provide our customers with the simple, secure, and reliable CMS platform they need. We have seen custom CMS platforms come and go over the years and recommend using a well-known CMS like the platforms mentioned above. This is because most custom CMS platforms have a limited shelf-life or the provider disappears; leaving you with the painful task of migrating to a better supported platform. Why take the risk? If you&#39;re in the market for a simple and reliable content management system, or if you currently have a CMS platform and would like to improve it, give us a call  our experts and standing by ready to help!<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Our Company has worked with Oracast on a couple of projects over the past 2<br>
years, where they have built us a system, specifically designed to meet the<br>
needs of our business. They have done an excellent job of understanding our<br>
needs, and have been creative in the solutions to the problems that we faced.<br>
The system that they built has raised our company&#39;s level of efficiency in the<br>
office and in the field. Oracast has continued to provide quick support when<br>
issues arise, and have always been great to deal with. We have appreciated our<br>
relationship with Oracast, and look forward to continuing to use their expertise in<br>
the future. - Melbern Vegetation Inc.<br>
<br>
*Look no further!* I had hired a lifelong friend to create a new web application for<br>
helping people understand vehicle warranty. 13 months and thousands of dollars<br>
later I was no closer to launching than I was when we started. In desperation I<br>
reached out to Oracast. Most assuredly one of my better decisions. Jes, Ryan and their team were phenomenal. Unfortunately, the program had originally been<br>
created in an outdated platform making future upgrades basically impossible.<br>
The solutions was to start from basically scratch and rewrite the entire code in<br>
PHP which would save money in the long run. Oracast stuck to their original<br>
quote without complaint even though the task had become much, MUCH larger.<br>
The end result is a web application that is exponentially better than what I had<br>
hoped for and allows for substantial growth and flexibility going forward. Ryan<br>
spent literally DAYS on the phone with me, evenings and weekends included, to<br>
ensure that the application was everything I required and more. I was made to<br>
feel like a big fish in a little pond even though this was the opposite of reality.<br>
This group will be my &#39;go to&#39; company permanently and I highly recommend them<br>
for whatever your requirements are. I cannot say enough great things about this<br>
company. Great people + great product = 100% lifelong customer loyalty! Do<br>
yourself a favour and hire them! You won&#39;t be disappointed. - Carwise Consulting Inc.<br>
<br>
Oracast has provided Snow Valley with a great new website that is easy to<br>
navigate, the graphics are visually appealing and they have provided us with the<br>
tools and knowledge to make fast and easy changes on our own! The build of our<br>
new website better reflects our company and is much more helpful to our<br>
customer base, as seen by the growth in the number of website viewers<br>
increasing by 20%! Oracast has exceeded our expectations and provided us with<br>
fast, friendly website help. - Snow Valley Edmonton
