                            In co-operation with Ontario mining companies, NORCAT has developed a common Contractor Orientation Program.<br>
<br>
The two-hour program focuses on:<br>
1.The safety rules and proper working practices for construction workers, and<br>
2.The general rules of conduct and work etiquette required of contractors working on company properties. <br>
<br>
NORCAT&#39;s Computer-Based Training materials ensure that the quality of the training program remains consistent.<br>
<br>
NORCAT&#39;s central database offers clients easy access to accurate training documentation.<br>
<br>
A successfully trained participant receives a NORCAT Contractor Pass. The NORCAT security pass allows the holder access to properties of participating companies.<br>

                            The NORCAT Underground Centre provides clients with a range of training and prototype development opportunities that are not available elsewhere in Canada. The former Falconbridge Fecunis Adit Mine in Onaping, Ontario serves as the perfect location for NORCATs 4-week Common Core Training program and for product testing in an actual underground environment.<br>
<br>
The layout is ideal for equipment and vehicles, accessible from two surface level entrances (Adits) in the side of the landscape, as opposed to drilling down into the earth. Higher elevations in the mine provide natural ventilation and drainage, with no need for water pumps or hoists.<br>
<br>
The Underground Centre has been used for promotional photography of mining tools, equipment and machinery in an underground environment, as well as a filming location for TV and music videos.<br>

                            Entrepreneurship can be learned. But the key, according to the Kauffman Foundation, is to provide education at teachable moments  when you are thinking about starting a business or ready to scale it. What entrepreneurs need isnt the type of abstract course they teach in business schools, but practical, relevant knowledge you can apply to your business.<br>

                            Speed to market is imperative and because of this competition to get products to market more quickly, many companies use rapid prototyping techniques to build parts for testing and analysis. Furthermore, as innovation-driven companies know all too well, customers and investors often want to see something to give them a better understanding of the product and how it functions to address the complex global market opportunity that it is designed to address. Our one-stop shop product design, prototyping, and testing group can assist in the following ways:<br>
Product technical design, engineering, and development<br>
Custom mechanical, electrical, and control system fabrication and assembly<br>
Product testing services for harsh and extreme environments<br>
3D printing, CNC machining, and rapid-prototyping<br>
General mentorship and advisory services including new market opportunity evaluation and product management<br>
<br>
In addition, our state-of-the-art NORCAT Underground Mine Testing Centre offers resources and equipment to support our clients interested in testing their technologies in an operating mine environment.<br>

                            There is no denying the importance of capital to help you start and accelerate the growth of your business. However, understanding the amount, the type, and the timing for capital is imperative.  NORCAT will help you navigate and understand the complex capital landscape and how the nuances, stage, and sector of your business will determine the most relevant and realistic capital opportunities for you.<br>
 <br>
Given the vastness and complexity of the global capital landscape, be it dilutive or non-dilutive capital, we encourage you to do your own research and connect with your mentors to learn about the different funding vehicles in our community and beyond. We have outlined some of the key sources of capital in the NORCAT ecosystem.<br>

                            The NORCAT Centre is a 70,000 square foot modern architecture marvel. Built in 2008, our centre includes fully equipped office, lab and shop facilities, prototyping services, training and development rooms, event venues and meeting places, retail services, and flexible, co-location, incubator space that brings together entrepreneurs to work alongside other like-minded entrepreneurs to share ideas, enhance networks, and discuss challenges and opportunities.<br>
THE NORCAT COMMONS:<br>
<br>
The NORCAT Commons is a creative and dynamic place designed for entrepreneurs to work together and share ideas to accelerate the growth of their scalable and sustainable businesses. Being a member of the NORCAT Commons means you have a flexible month-to-month, co-location working space that brings you together with other like-minded entrepreneurs to share ideas, enhance your network, and discuss challenges and opportunities to help you expedite the growth of your business. To join this group and have an address in one of Canadas leading innovation centres, you must first connect and engage with a NORCAT Mentor.<br>
THE NORCAT INCUBATOR:<br>
<br>
As you continue to grow and scale your business, you will undoubtedly need to graduate to more formal, dedicated, longer-term office and / or shop space to accommodate your evolving staff and business needs. Similar to the NORCAT Commons, the NORCAT Incubator is dedicated space, but offers more privacy for clients that are still keen to participate and work with others in our vibrant ecosystem.<br>
 THE NORCAT LONG-TERM RESIDENCY PROGRAM:<br>
<br>
The NORCAT Long-Term Residency Program is designed for our larger, flagship anchor tenants that play an active role in our innovation, commercialization, and entrepreneurial ecosystem. These tenants often require greater than 5,000 square feet of space and are engaged on a multi-year contract. If your business is interested in being in our ecosystem, having close proximity and access to other high quality entrepreneurial endeavours, and committed to contributing to a dynamic community, then reach out to us and will we schedule a follow up meeting with you.<br>

                            In co-operation with Ontario mining companies, NORCAT has developed a common Contractor Orientation Program.<br>
<br>
The two-hour program focuses on:<br>
1.The safety rules and proper working practices for construction workers, and<br>
2.The general rules of conduct and work etiquette required of contractors working on company properties. <br>
<br>
NORCAT&#39;s Computer-Based Training materials ensure that the quality of the training program remains consistent.<br>
<br>
NORCAT&#39;s central database offers clients easy access to accurate training documentation.<br>
<br>
A successfully trained participant receives a NORCAT Contractor Pass. The NORCAT security pass allows the holder access to properties of participating companies.<br>

                            The NORCAT Underground Centre provides clients with a range of training and prototype development opportunities that are not available elsewhere in Canada. The former Falconbridge Fecunis Adit Mine in Onaping, Ontario serves as the perfect location for NORCATs 4-week Common Core Training program and for product testing in an actual underground environment.<br>
<br>
The layout is ideal for equipment and vehicles, accessible from two surface level entrances (Adits) in the side of the landscape, as opposed to drilling down into the earth. Higher elevations in the mine provide natural ventilation and drainage, with no need for water pumps or hoists.<br>
<br>
The Underground Centre has been used for promotional photography of mining tools, equipment and machinery in an underground environment, as well as a filming location for TV and music videos.<br>

                            Entrepreneurship can be learned. But the key, according to the Kauffman Foundation, is to provide education at teachable moments  when you are thinking about starting a business or ready to scale it. What entrepreneurs need isnt the type of abstract course they teach in business schools, but practical, relevant knowledge you can apply to your business.<br>

                            Speed to market is imperative and because of this competition to get products to market more quickly, many companies use rapid prototyping techniques to build parts for testing and analysis. Furthermore, as innovation-driven companies know all too well, customers and investors often want to see something to give them a better understanding of the product and how it functions to address the complex global market opportunity that it is designed to address. Our one-stop shop product design, prototyping, and testing group can assist in the following ways:<br>
Product technical design, engineering, and development<br>
Custom mechanical, electrical, and control system fabrication and assembly<br>
Product testing services for harsh and extreme environments<br>
3D printing, CNC machining, and rapid-prototyping<br>
General mentorship and advisory services including new market opportunity evaluation and product management<br>
<br>
In addition, our state-of-the-art NORCAT Underground Mine Testing Centre offers resources and equipment to support our clients interested in testing their technologies in an operating mine environment.<br>

                            There is no denying the importance of capital to help you start and accelerate the growth of your business. However, understanding the amount, the type, and the timing for capital is imperative.  NORCAT will help you navigate and understand the complex capital landscape and how the nuances, stage, and sector of your business will determine the most relevant and realistic capital opportunities for you.<br>
 <br>
Given the vastness and complexity of the global capital landscape, be it dilutive or non-dilutive capital, we encourage you to do your own research and connect with your mentors to learn about the different funding vehicles in our community and beyond. We have outlined some of the key sources of capital in the NORCAT ecosystem.<br>

                            The NORCAT Centre is a 70,000 square foot modern architecture marvel. Built in 2008, our centre includes fully equipped office, lab and shop facilities, prototyping services, training and development rooms, event venues and meeting places, retail services, and flexible, co-location, incubator space that brings together entrepreneurs to work alongside other like-minded entrepreneurs to share ideas, enhance networks, and discuss challenges and opportunities.<br>
THE NORCAT COMMONS:<br>
<br>
The NORCAT Commons is a creative and dynamic place designed for entrepreneurs to work together and share ideas to accelerate the growth of their scalable and sustainable businesses. Being a member of the NORCAT Commons means you have a flexible month-to-month, co-location working space that brings you together with other like-minded entrepreneurs to share ideas, enhance your network, and discuss challenges and opportunities to help you expedite the growth of your business. To join this group and have an address in one of Canadas leading innovation centres, you must first connect and engage with a NORCAT Mentor.<br>
THE NORCAT INCUBATOR:<br>
<br>
As you continue to grow and scale your business, you will undoubtedly need to graduate to more formal, dedicated, longer-term office and / or shop space to accommodate your evolving staff and business needs. Similar to the NORCAT Commons, the NORCAT Incubator is dedicated space, but offers more privacy for clients that are still keen to participate and work with others in our vibrant ecosystem.<br>
 THE NORCAT LONG-TERM RESIDENCY PROGRAM:<br>
<br>
The NORCAT Long-Term Residency Program is designed for our larger, flagship anchor tenants that play an active role in our innovation, commercialization, and entrepreneurial ecosystem. These tenants often require greater than 5,000 square feet of space and are engaged on a multi-year contract. If your business is interested in being in our ecosystem, having close proximity and access to other high quality entrepreneurial endeavours, and committed to contributing to a dynamic community, then reach out to us and will we schedule a follow up meeting with you.<br>
