              CANADA LINE RAPID TRANSIT PROJECT<br>
In 2005, the Canada Line Rapid Transit Project was procured as a $1.9-billion, public-private partnership with a 35-year operations and maintenance component. SNC-Lavalin Inc. submitted the winning bid to design, build, partially finance, and operate the Canada Line, and worked with TransLink, the Cities of Vancouver and Richmond, and the Vancouver International Airport Authority to integrate this 18.5-km and 16-station rapid transit line into unique urban networks using elevated, underground, and at-grade components. <br>
SNC-Lavalins management, design, construction, and operations teams engineered an alignment that used every feasible guideway and station configuration to navigate Metro Vancouvers geometric constraints. A 2.5-km bored tunnel passed under downtown high-rise buildings and underground structures, and integrated three stations into existing buildings. A cut-and-cover tunnel along Cambie Street, which flipped between stacked and side-by-side configurations, resolved vertical and horizontal alignment challenges, while an elevated guideway through Richmond helped shape No.3 Roads new street vision.<br>
The project achieved firsts for Metro Vancouvers rapid transit network: the North Arm Bridge, North Americas first extradosed, cable-stayed bridge; Hyundai-Rotems metro vehicle received its North American introduction and to Automatic Train Control; micropiles supported the 19-metre-deep excavation of Yaletown station. Throughout these technical challenges was SNC-Lavalins sensitivity to impacted communities. An integrated engineering and public communications team led one of the largest public outreach initiatives undertaken in BC.<br>
Successfully delivered on budget and 110 days ahead of schedule, the Canada Line Rapid Transit Project continues to surpass expectations with a system reliability weighing in at 98.9 percent and a capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 20 to 27 kilotonnes per year, making the Canada Line an important milestone in shaping Metro Vancouvers transit-oriented future.<br>

              CANADA LINE RAPID TRANSIT PROJECT<br>
In 2005, the Canada Line Rapid Transit Project was procured as a $1.9-billion, public-private partnership with a 35-year operations and maintenance component. SNC-Lavalin Inc. submitted the winning bid to design, build, partially finance, and operate the Canada Line, and worked with TransLink, the Cities of Vancouver and Richmond, and the Vancouver International Airport Authority to integrate this 18.5-km and 16-station rapid transit line into unique urban networks using elevated, underground, and at-grade components. <br>
SNC-Lavalins management, design, construction, and operations teams engineered an alignment that used every feasible guideway and station configuration to navigate Metro Vancouvers geometric constraints. A 2.5-km bored tunnel passed under downtown high-rise buildings and underground structures, and integrated three stations into existing buildings. A cut-and-cover tunnel along Cambie Street, which flipped between stacked and side-by-side configurations, resolved vertical and horizontal alignment challenges, while an elevated guideway through Richmond helped shape No.3 Roads new street vision.<br>
The project achieved firsts for Metro Vancouvers rapid transit network: the North Arm Bridge, North Americas first extradosed, cable-stayed bridge; Hyundai-Rotems metro vehicle received its North American introduction and to Automatic Train Control; micropiles supported the 19-metre-deep excavation of Yaletown station. Throughout these technical challenges was SNC-Lavalins sensitivity to impacted communities. An integrated engineering and public communications team led one of the largest public outreach initiatives undertaken in BC.<br>
Successfully delivered on budget and 110 days ahead of schedule, the Canada Line Rapid Transit Project continues to surpass expectations with a system reliability weighing in at 98.9 percent and a capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 20 to 27 kilotonnes per year, making the Canada Line an important milestone in shaping Metro Vancouvers transit-oriented future.<br>
