                            The Employer Brand is What People Say About You When Your Not There<br>
For a brand to attract and inspire consider the “W” factor:<br>
<br>
why and who: the desired impact, the purpose and the target audience;<br>
what: its relevance in addressing expectations;<br>
wow: a passion that energizes and resonates with people.<br>
How can you discover and own your unique employer brand? From your DNA, emotional advantages, practices, reputation, brand positioning, and the true experience of your employees and candidates. What is your employee value proposition? Let us work with you on this inspiring journey.<br>
<br>
Our Approach For Profitable Growth<br>
We consider the brand as the company&#39;s foundation. Its DNA (culture, purpose, values...) and the promise made to its different target groups: customers, employees, partners, suppliers... its reputation which relies on the experience lived in contact with the brand.<br>
<br>
Sustaining a strong brand requires an alignment between four components: people, technology-process, structure and finance. The perception of the brand depends on the emotional contact we have with it.<br>
<br>
At Illico Hodes, we believe people make the difference. We rely on people to deliver distinctive employee experience that will provide a great customer experience and generate growth. The more aligned, engaged and passionate the employees, the more they reinforce the brand and deliver the promise to customers.<br>
<br>
ALIGN: guide action towards the objectives of the company.<br>
ENGAGE: to ensure all adhere to it and find it meaningful.<br>
ACTIVATE: encourage transition to concrete behaviors.<br>

We incorporate research, analysis, strategy and a co-creative perspective in our solutions - not because we think it works - but because we know it does.<br>
How We Work <br>
Imagine collaborative work that enhances the creation of solutions according to your culture and challenges. Our way of co-creating stimulates ideas, promotes the transfer of knowledge, generates transformation and encourages autonomy.<br>
<br>

                            Networking is the Way Ahead <br>
<br>
An ambassador program is an integrated dimension of the employer brand. A Harvard study finds that brand advocacy is more important than brand image and employee/customer satisfaction. Advocating and promoting a brand is significantly different than aiming for satisfaction, even loyalty. It is the result of mobilized and engaged employees. <br>
<br>

The talent acquisition market has shifted toward the candidate. Today, with social media, candidates have a voice. Discover how to differentiate your company. Benchmark how the candidate perceives his overall experience. Reinforce your employer brand and have positive spillover to employee engagement.<br>
<br>
We are an active member of the CandE Canada Council, a part of the Canadian Talent Board. Talent Board is a non-profit organization with certifications in North America and the United Kingdom. The mission of Talent Board is to facilitate the evolution of the employment candidate experience principally through the annual production of The Candidate Experience Awards CandE. Talent Board is funded by donations.<br>
<br>
We help and encourage companies to benchmark and improve their candidate experience. Any corporation that is interested in enhancing the candidate experience they provide, regardless of sophistication, will benefit from participating in the benchmark process. Companies that participate can receive access to data that benchmarks their candidate experience against the aggregate of all winners.<br>

<br>
<br>
They are now major issues that requires an integrated ecosystem that allows to develop an understanding of the recruitment market, to position yourself in front of the lot.<br>
<br>
To hire the best talent today, it takes a complete Web ecosystem that is coherent with your brand, engaging and effective. The traditional recruiting process — one of candidates responding to job board postings, completing a form, submitting resumes, and waiting with fingers crossed — is dead.<br>
<br>
Today, companies and candidates participate in a much more holistic and immersive experience. One that wraps brand, marketing, relationship management, and recruiting into one, with more than one Web property. Companies are presenting elegantly branded career websites and social media pages, that encourage visitors to join their community networks into an easy to use and efficient database. Candidates want to talk with recruiters and in some cases, current employees, before deciding if a company is a good fit and worth applying to.<br>
<br>
Today, sourcers, recruiters and hiring managers, must proactively search, find, and nurture candidates in this tough market. They need tools that empower them to do this. Easy to use, effective and powerful tools with reliable, useful and actionable metrics to improve their performance in real time.<br>
<br>
Talent acquisition managers must understand the job market, the sources, the candidate’s behavior (active and passive), trends and best practices. They must have a global perspective of the activities and recruitment performance of the entire organization.<br>
<br>
Our Recruitment Ecosystem Includes<br>
Recruitment marketing and social sourcing with analytics<br>
An engaging career website experience<br>
Candidate engagement opportunities through social media<br>
Talent communities for future job opportunities<br>
Streamlined application process and workflow with candidate visibility into status<br>
Collaborative functionality to support the hiring team<br>
Mobile functionality for candidates, recruiters, and hiring managers<br>

                            The Employer Brand is What People Say About You When Your Not There<br>
For a brand to attract and inspire consider the “W” factor:<br>
<br>
why and who: the desired impact, the purpose and the target audience;<br>
what: its relevance in addressing expectations;<br>
wow: a passion that energizes and resonates with people.<br>
How can you discover and own your unique employer brand? From your DNA, emotional advantages, practices, reputation, brand positioning, and the true experience of your employees and candidates. What is your employee value proposition? Let us work with you on this inspiring journey.<br>
<br>
Our Approach For Profitable Growth<br>
We consider the brand as the company&#39;s foundation. Its DNA (culture, purpose, values...) and the promise made to its different target groups: customers, employees, partners, suppliers... its reputation which relies on the experience lived in contact with the brand.<br>
<br>
Sustaining a strong brand requires an alignment between four components: people, technology-process, structure and finance. The perception of the brand depends on the emotional contact we have with it.<br>
<br>
At Illico Hodes, we believe people make the difference. We rely on people to deliver distinctive employee experience that will provide a great customer experience and generate growth. The more aligned, engaged and passionate the employees, the more they reinforce the brand and deliver the promise to customers.<br>
<br>
ALIGN: guide action towards the objectives of the company.<br>
ENGAGE: to ensure all adhere to it and find it meaningful.<br>
ACTIVATE: encourage transition to concrete behaviors.<br>

We provide consultancy services in all aspects of mobilization, communication and brand. Our specialists are at the forefront of their fields. We incorporate research, analysis, strategy and a co-creative perspective in our solutions - not because we think it works - but because we know it does.<br>

                            Networking is the Way Ahead <br>
<br>
An ambassador program is an integrated dimension of the employer brand. A Harvard study finds that brand advocacy is more important than brand image and employee/customer satisfaction. Advocating and promoting a brand is significantly different than aiming for satisfaction, even loyalty. It is the result of mobilized and engaged employees. <br>
<br>
An ambassador program structures and promotes engagement. We develop the action plan with the partners and working committee of the organization. We support you through change and celebrate your successes! Let us help you <br>

We are an active member of the CandE Canada Council, a part of the Canadian Talent Board. Talent Board is a non-profit organization with certifications in North America and the United Kingdom. The mission of Talent Board is to facilitate the evolution of the employment candidate experience principally through the annual production of The Candidate Experience Awards CandE. Talent Board is funded by donations.<br>
<br>
We help and encourage companies to benchmark and improve their candidate experience. Any corporation that is interested in enhancing the candidate experience they provide, regardless of sophistication, will benefit from participating in the benchmark process. Companies that participate can receive access to data that benchmarks their candidate experience against the aggregate of all winners.<br>

<br>
<br>
They are now major issues that requires an integrated ecosystem that allows to develop an understanding of the recruitment market, to position yourself in front of the lot.<br>
<br>
To hire the best talent today, it takes a complete Web ecosystem that is coherent with your brand, engaging and effective. The traditional recruiting process — one of candidates responding to job board postings, completing a form, submitting resumes, and waiting with fingers crossed — is dead.<br>
<br>
Today, companies and candidates participate in a much more holistic and immersive experience. One that wraps brand, marketing, relationship management, and recruiting into one, with more than one Web property. Companies are presenting elegantly branded career websites and social media pages, that encourage visitors to join their community networks into an easy to use and efficient database. Candidates want to talk with recruiters and in some cases, current employees, before deciding if a company is a good fit and worth applying to.<br>
<br>
Today, sourcers, recruiters and hiring managers, must proactively search, find, and nurture candidates in this tough market. They need tools that empower them to do this. Easy to use, effective and powerful tools with reliable, useful and actionable metrics to improve their performance in real time.<br>
<br>
Talent acquisition managers must understand the job market, the sources, the candidate’s behavior (active and passive), trends and best practices. They must have a global perspective of the activities and recruitment performance of the entire organization.<br>
<br>
Our Recruitment Ecosystem Includes<br>
Recruitment marketing and social sourcing with analytics<br>
An engaging career website experience<br>
Candidate engagement opportunities through social media<br>
Talent communities for future job opportunities<br>
Streamlined application process and workflow with candidate visibility into status<br>
Collaborative functionality to support the hiring team<br>
Mobile functionality for candidates, recruiters, and hiring managers<br>
HR analytics to support smart managing and hiring decisions<br>
