                            Few things have the potential to impact rising property values, leasing opportunities or building renovations like the discovery of asbestos.<br>
<br>
Fortunately for clients, we offer a level of expertise in asbestos management that is unparalleled in Atlantic Canada.<br>
<br>
The first step is the identification of asbestos materials, both friable (greater potential to release dust) and non-friable (contained within solid building materials). Asbestos testing is the responsibility of anyone who launches a renovation, demolition or maintenance project that results in structural disturbance. Our team members are well-equipped to provide this service, employing the custom developed, web-based application, Hazardous Material Information System (HMIS) to provide necessary results in real-time.<br>
<br>
The next step, a thorough analysis of any suspect material, is carried out in the laboratory of our Dartmouth office, or in our portable laboratory, which can be set up at any building site. Our lab operates under the Quality Management System registered to the ISO 9001:2008 standard, which means clients receive accurate and immediate results. <br>
<br>
Our analysts have been trained at the McCrone Research Institute in Chicago - the worlds preeminent leader in microscopy education and research. The benefit is that clients, outside consultants and building owners who come to us with samples are assured of a precise and legally defensible report. <br>
<br>
We also take care of:<br>
<br>
Asbestos Abatement Project Design &amp; Management<br>
The combined expertise of our engineers, project managers, estimators and hygienists allow us to create individualized plans for asbestos removal, repair, re-fireproofing, demolition and other related projects. We ensure each plan is designed using clear terms and straight-forward explanations. These can be incorporated into tender packages, or created as stand-alone documents.<br>
<br>
Inspection &amp; Air Monitoring Services<br>
When building occupants and workers need to know their air is free from harmful asbestos, and in compliance with all legislated regulations, they come to Pinchin LeBlanc. Our process for the inspection of asbestos removal is done as safely as possible, focusing on enclosure, decontamination, negative pressure and dust suppression, and the implementation of worker protection measures.<br>

                            A wide range of environmental responsibilities rest on the shoulders of building owners, project managers, engineers and architects; as a leader in the management of hazardous materials, Pinchin LeBlanc is often brought on board to provide project specifications and design. There is virtually no room for error where hazardous materials and substances are concerned, so expertise is critical. That is what we deliver, and it is evident in every facet of the project, including all environmental, disposal, health, safety, and cost-related issues. <br>
<br>
How we can help:<br>
<br>
Surveys for Hazardous Materials<br>
We identify hazardous materials - specifically any biological, chemical or physical agent where exposure could be harmful to human health. Asbestos, lead, silica, mercury, arsenic, benzene, isocyanates, vinyl chloride monomer, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and coke oven emissions all fall under that category. Our job is to confirm the presence and levels of these hazardous materials through comprehensive surveys that lend themselves to the creation of customized handling and budgeting plans. <br>
<br>
Lead Paint Identification and Control<br>
Lead, often present in older, rust-resistant paints, can require special handling and disposal procedures that must be left to the professionals. We use X-Ray Florescent analyzers for an immediate, on-site reading, as well as the traditional paint scrape laboratory analysis method.<br>
<br>
PCB Identification and Control<br>
In addition to surveys, we assist our clients in the preparation of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) management plans and specifications; all details, including packaging, containment, and destruction, are taken care of with the utmost concern for environmental impact and safety.<br>

                            Good indoor air quality is essential, as is testing and investigation in order to achieve or maintain it. We do both, and we do it often, as common synthetic construction materials and finishing products can sometimes send unwanted gases into the environment. While they may not be toxic, these gasses do affect the health of occupants, commonly resulting in diminished energy levels and productivity. We also conduct testing for the presence of fungus and mould, isolating sources and devising site-specific remediation plans.<br>
<br>
Other ways we assist, guide and advise:<br>
<br>
Reviewing and evaluating occupant concerns and activities<br>
Evaluating the overall ventilation effectiveness through carbon dioxide mapping <br>
Assessing the design, operation, and maintenance of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems<br>
Measuring temperature, humidity, air pressure, air velocity, and carbon monoxide <br>
Examining the building for contaminant sources (both indoor and outdoor)<br>
Preparing a detailed report on the source of the problem and recommendations <br>
Conducting microbiological testing to determine the presence of fungus <br>
Conducting annual or bi-annual Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) surveys to analyze control measures<br>

                            We carry out Environmental Site Assessments (known as ESAs) in cases where environmental liability may be at issue in the care, custody or control of a property. We apply a phased approach to environmental assessment that takes into account recognized standards of procedure, financial considerations, and the importance of specialized training.<br>
<br>
Our senior environmental professionals not only possess highly evolved skills in this area, but have actually created and delivered training programs in site assessment and remediation at Dalhousie University, and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).<br>
<br>
The Phased ESA is used to help in the characterization of environmental issues and associated contaminant levels that could affect a property or the natural environment.<br>
<br>
A Phase I ESA is non-intrusive, and involves professional opinions on the likelihood of common environmental issues ranging from the possible presence of hazardous building materials (such as lead paint or asbestos), to past and present uses of the site and surrounding properties. This would involve a site visit, interviews, regulatory database searches, and an evaluation of all relevant information. <br>
Phase II ESA, the second-level characterization, would involve confirming the presence or absence of any potential environmental issues identified during the Phase I ESA through an intrusive investigation.  It might involve sampling potentially hazardous building materials or drilling boreholes and installing monitor wells in order to assess soil and groundwater. Assessments are carried out by our team of geoscientists, chemists, engineers and specialists, who collaborate to confirm all relevant details, and to create a plan that addresses the full range of problems that could arise as a result of these contaminants.<br>
 <br>
We also provide Risk-Based Corrective Action (RBCA) modeling for petroleum-impacted sites. The RBCA model has been developed specifically for use in Atlantic Canada, and is based on a tiered approach where contamination levels are assessed through computer modeling to create Site Specific Target Levels (SSTLs) for the affected property.<br>
<br>
Once the site has been fully characterized, a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) is prepared to address the site conditions. Approach, methodology, physical conditions, area and quantities, constraints (including site access), and special considerations would all be included in the RAP. The final step would be Site Remediation, which is the actual implementation of steps outlined in the RAP, and could include risk assessment (i.e. RBCA modeling or other regulatory accepted methods), physical remediation, or a combination of the two.  The overall objective is to achieve Site Closure through regulatory compliance.<br>

                            Few things have the potential to impact rising property values, leasing opportunities or building renovations like the discovery of asbestos.<br>
<br>
Fortunately for clients, we offer a level of expertise in asbestos management that is unparalleled in Atlantic Canada.<br>
<br>
The first step is the identification of asbestos materials, both friable (greater potential to release dust) and non-friable (contained within solid building materials). Asbestos testing is the responsibility of anyone who launches a renovation, demolition or maintenance project that results in structural disturbance. Our team members are well-equipped to provide this service, employing the custom developed, web-based application, Hazardous Material Information System (HMIS) to provide necessary results in real-time.<br>
<br>
The next step, a thorough analysis of any suspect material, is carried out in the laboratory of our Dartmouth office, or in our portable laboratory, which can be set up at any building site. Our lab operates under the Quality Management System registered to the ISO 9001:2008 standard, which means clients receive accurate and immediate results. <br>
<br>
Our analysts have been trained at the McCrone Research Institute in Chicago - the worlds preeminent leader in microscopy education and research. The benefit is that clients, outside consultants and building owners who come to us with samples are assured of a precise and legally defensible report. <br>
<br>
We also take care of:<br>
<br>
Asbestos Abatement Project Design &amp; Management<br>
The combined expertise of our engineers, project managers, estimators and hygienists allow us to create individualized plans for asbestos removal, repair, re-fireproofing, demolition and other related projects. We ensure each plan is designed using clear terms and straight-forward explanations. These can be incorporated into tender packages, or created as stand-alone documents.<br>
<br>
Inspection &amp; Air Monitoring Services<br>
When building occupants and workers need to know their air is free from harmful asbestos, and in compliance with all legislated regulations, they come to Pinchin LeBlanc. Our process for the inspection of asbestos removal is done as safely as possible, focusing on enclosure, decontamination, negative pressure and dust suppression, and the implementation of worker protection measures.<br>

                            A wide range of environmental responsibilities rest on the shoulders of building owners, project managers, engineers and architects; as a leader in the management of hazardous materials, Pinchin LeBlanc is often brought on board to provide project specifications and design. There is virtually no room for error where hazardous materials and substances are concerned, so expertise is critical. That is what we deliver, and it is evident in every facet of the project, including all environmental, disposal, health, safety, and cost-related issues. <br>
<br>
How we can help:<br>
<br>
Surveys for Hazardous Materials<br>
We identify hazardous materials - specifically any biological, chemical or physical agent where exposure could be harmful to human health. Asbestos, lead, silica, mercury, arsenic, benzene, isocyanates, vinyl chloride monomer, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and coke oven emissions all fall under that category. Our job is to confirm the presence and levels of these hazardous materials through comprehensive surveys that lend themselves to the creation of customized handling and budgeting plans. <br>
<br>
Lead Paint Identification and Control<br>
Lead, often present in older, rust-resistant paints, can require special handling and disposal procedures that must be left to the professionals. We use X-Ray Florescent analyzers for an immediate, on-site reading, as well as the traditional paint scrape laboratory analysis method.<br>
<br>
PCB Identification and Control<br>
In addition to surveys, we assist our clients in the preparation of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) management plans and specifications; all details, including packaging, containment, and destruction, are taken care of with the utmost concern for environmental impact and safety.<br>

                            Good indoor air quality is essential, as is testing and investigation in order to achieve or maintain it. We do both, and we do it often, as common synthetic construction materials and finishing products can sometimes send unwanted gases into the environment. While they may not be toxic, these gasses do affect the health of occupants, commonly resulting in diminished energy levels and productivity. We also conduct testing for the presence of fungus and mould, isolating sources and devising site-specific remediation plans.<br>
<br>
Other ways we assist, guide and advise:<br>
<br>
Reviewing and evaluating occupant concerns and activities<br>
Evaluating the overall ventilation effectiveness through carbon dioxide mapping <br>
Assessing the design, operation, and maintenance of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems<br>
Measuring temperature, humidity, air pressure, air velocity, and carbon monoxide <br>
Examining the building for contaminant sources (both indoor and outdoor)<br>
Preparing a detailed report on the source of the problem and recommendations <br>
Conducting microbiological testing to determine the presence of fungus <br>
Conducting annual or bi-annual Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) surveys to analyze control measures<br>

                            We carry out Environmental Site Assessments (known as ESAs) in cases where environmental liability may be at issue in the care, custody or control of a property. We apply a phased approach to environmental assessment that takes into account recognized standards of procedure, financial considerations, and the importance of specialized training.<br>
<br>
Our senior environmental professionals not only possess highly evolved skills in this area, but have actually created and delivered training programs in site assessment and remediation at Dalhousie University, and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).<br>
<br>
The Phased ESA is used to help in the characterization of environmental issues and associated contaminant levels that could affect a property or the natural environment.<br>
<br>
A Phase I ESA is non-intrusive, and involves professional opinions on the likelihood of common environmental issues ranging from the possible presence of hazardous building materials (such as lead paint or asbestos), to past and present uses of the site and surrounding properties. This would involve a site visit, interviews, regulatory database searches, and an evaluation of all relevant information. <br>
Phase II ESA, the second-level characterization, would involve confirming the presence or absence of any potential environmental issues identified during the Phase I ESA through an intrusive investigation.  It might involve sampling potentially hazardous building materials or drilling boreholes and installing monitor wells in order to assess soil and groundwater. Assessments are carried out by our team of geoscientists, chemists, engineers and specialists, who collaborate to confirm all relevant details, and to create a plan that addresses the full range of problems that could arise as a result of these contaminants.<br>
 <br>
We also provide Risk-Based Corrective Action (RBCA) modeling for petroleum-impacted sites. The RBCA model has been developed specifically for use in Atlantic Canada, and is based on a tiered approach where contamination levels are assessed through computer modeling to create Site Specific Target Levels (SSTLs) for the affected property.<br>
<br>
Once the site has been fully characterized, a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) is prepared to address the site conditions. Approach, methodology, physical conditions, area and quantities, constraints (including site access), and special considerations would all be included in the RAP. The final step would be Site Remediation, which is the actual implementation of steps outlined in the RAP, and could include risk assessment (i.e. RBCA modeling or other regulatory accepted methods), physical remediation, or a combination of the two.  The overall objective is to achieve Site Closure through regulatory compliance.<br>
