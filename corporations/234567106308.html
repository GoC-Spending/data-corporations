<br>
Euro-Rite Cabinets Ltd. (SEO, Web Development, CMS)<br>
<br>
Within a month of launching the new and improved website, the majority of Euro-Rites primary keywords were ranking on page one of Google. With the new functionality upgrades and the ongoing monthly SEO and support programs, Euro-Rite is currently receiving more website traffic than ever before thanks to fresh and relevant content. More importantly, theyre getting the right traffic, which has generated more qualified leads.<br>
<br>
With the increased visibility, more consumers have been able to identify a budget using the Instant Estimate and their cabinet specifications with Euro-Rites kitchen planner and closet organizer tools on their website. This has created a stronger user experience by providing a better understanding of the end-consumer needs. It has also made it much easier for their dealers to sell their products because of the increased knowledge of cabinet specifications and measurements beforehand.<br>
<br>
Euro-Rite is now producing an average of 30 to 40 new leads a month. Not only have they been hitting their revenue expectations, but they are now growing their business to new heights.<br>
<br>

<br>
The new geographical landing pages resulted in more local searches and greater visibility than they ever had in the past. The ongoing support program allows Merit Kitchens to have prompt updates implemented on their website, keeping content fresh and maintaining their dominance on Google and Bings search engine results page.<br>
<br>
Since the launch of the new website, Merit Kitchens has received close to one hundred more phone calls and fifty new leads per month. In addition to the consumer calls, they also average an additional five new dealer inquires per month.<br>
<br>
Merit Kitchens has been able to get a much larger ROI from their marketing budget, and even now our ongoing SEO maintenance services are continuing to help the company grow and rank higher and higher on search engines.<br>

<br>
Euro-Rite Cabinets Ltd. (SEO, Web Development, CMS)<br>
<br>
Within a month of launching the new and improved website, the majority of Euro-Rites primary keywords were ranking on page one of Google. With the new functionality upgrades and the ongoing monthly SEO and support programs, Euro-Rite is currently receiving more website traffic than ever before thanks to fresh and relevant content. More importantly, theyre getting the right traffic, which has generated more qualified leads.<br>
<br>
With the increased visibility, more consumers have been able to identify a budget using the Instant Estimate and their cabinet specifications with Euro-Rites kitchen planner and closet organizer tools on their website. This has created a stronger user experience by providing a better understanding of the end-consumer needs. It has also made it much easier for their dealers to sell their products because of the increased knowledge of cabinet specifications and measurements beforehand.<br>
<br>
Euro-Rite is now producing an average of 30 to 40 new leads a month. Not only have they been hitting their revenue expectations, but they are now growing their business to new heights.<br>

The new geographical landing pages resulted in more local searches and greater visibility than they ever had in the past. The ongoing support program allows Merit Kitchens to have prompt updates implemented on their website, keeping content fresh and maintaining their dominance on Google and Bings search engine results page.<br>
<br>
Since the launch of the new website, Merit Kitchens has received close to one hundred more phone calls and fifty new leads per month. In addition to the consumer calls, they also average an additional five new dealer inquires per month.<br>
<br>
Merit Kitchens has been able to get a much larger ROI from their marketing budget, and even now our ongoing SEO maintenance services are continuing to help the company grow and rank higher and higher on search engines.<br>
