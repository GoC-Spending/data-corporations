help you when planning and preparing for business and technical <br>
presentations.  The content of this customized one-day workshop <br>

<br>
· Self-Analysis; am I the bore I think I am?<br>
· Factors to consider before you begin; what am I getting into?<br>
· Purpose of the presentation; sell, tell, defend, support, <br>
  report?<br>
· Analysing your audience; never talk to a  naked audience<br>
· Organizing your presentation; tell them what you are going to  <br>
  tell them, tell them, and tell them what you told them<br>
· Using visual aids; and other tools that provide an impact<br>
· Rehearsing your presentation; practice produces precision<br>
· Making the presentation; comparing this to life and death<br>

 Teamwork Workshop<br>
A team that works well together is not a chance event.  Team <br>
working relationships can be improved through systematic <br>
development of skills and attitudes.  This workshop explores <br>
characteristics of effective teams.  Some exercises are based <br>
upon your Myers Briggs preferences.<br>
If you have not completed the MBTI we can arrange for you to <br>
complete a self-scoring version of the instrument.<br>

                            MAKING BETTER BUSINESS PRESENTATIONS:<br>
A Practical Guide for Success<br>
Jessica Starkman<br>
STARBOND CONSULTING<br>
<br>
Research has shown that people would rather die than make a <br>
public presentation.  Research has also proven that presentation <br>
skills are a significant factor in winning over or influencing <br>
audiences.  This program provides you with a practical guide to <br>
help you when planning and preparing for business and technical <br>
presentations.  The content of this customized one-day workshop <br>
can cover the following topics: <br>
<br>
· Self-Analysis; am I the bore I think I am?<br>
· Factors to consider before you begin; what am I getting into?<br>
· Purpose of the presentation; sell, tell, defend, support, <br>
  report?<br>
· Analysing your audience; never talk to a  naked audience<br>
· Organizing your presentation; tell them what you are going to  <br>
  tell them, tell them, and tell them what you told them<br>
· Using visual aids; and other tools that provide an impact<br>
· Rehearsing your presentation; practice produces precision<br>
· Making the presentation; comparing this to life and death<br>
· Dealing with anxiety; overcoming stage fright<br>
· Answering questions; consider a question as a compliment<br>
· Practising your presentation<br>
<br>
 Teamwork Workshop<br>
A team that works well together is not a chance event.  Team <br>
working relationships can be improved through systematic <br>
development of skills and attitudes.  This workshop explores <br>
characteristics of effective teams.  Some exercises are based <br>
upon your Myers Briggs preferences.<br>
If you have not completed the MBTI we can arrange for you to <br>
complete a self-scoring version of the instrument.<br>
