                            Stakeholder Cost Reporting (SCR) facilitates system user innovation from the point of data capture and validation, to the reporting of data and creation of business intelligence by:<br>
 providing meaningful information to different levels of the organization with the same data.  Tactical data, which is typically more granular in nature, is used at the operational level to drive operational efficiency, is simultaneously mapped to strategic data, which is used at the executive level to support long term corporate planning.<br>
 enabling a digital document strategy to minimize costs associated with manual paper records, systems, human resources and professional audit services.<br>
 creating a blue sky view of programs and projects as well as immediate access to detail including the originating source document. <br>
 establishing business process for corporate metrics to be captured and reported. The process is well documented and easy to maintain by people and requires little training. The process also creates a segregation of duties, authorization accountability, continuous audit trails and automatic tracking reports for individuals required to monitor and process tasks.   <br>
 impacting the ERP implementation strategy, by allowing smaller organizational units to adopt a Best of Breed  (BOB) application strategy, while improving value of the data provided to the ERP system. SCR facilitates BOB by ensuring that islands of data have a single source of data that is shared by all systems, including the data requirements of the corporate ERP system. ERP implementation ROI is improved by having ERP functionality at the core of the organization where change is minimal, while the BOB approach is implemented in the peripheral Business Units where change is rapid and continuous.<br>
 supporting a flat BU organizational structure with powerful reporting features to create a transparent team environment. When transparency is used with a well-defined business process, team politics are minimized and people tend to focus on their specific duties, which improves the performance of the whole team.<br>
 facilitating cost allocation techniques that are developed and consistently applied to deliver on the unique reporting requirements of every client stakeholder. <br>

A typical GCI project includes the following Project phases:<br>
I.	Requirements Analysis<br>
II.	Technology acquisition, modification, documentation<br>
III.	System installation and training<br>
<br>
REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS<br>
A comprehensive study thoroughly evaluates the clients&#39; <br>
objectives, requirements and allocated data management <br>
resources.  The study provides the client with a detailed <br>
report summarizing study findings, information technology <br>
strategy, recommendations, implementation plan, projected <br>
budget and related time frames.<br>
<br>
<br>
TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION, MODIFICATION AND DOCUMENTATION<br>
The primary focus of this project phase is development of <br>
Policy, Procedures and Software. Additional activities <br>
typically include asset acquisition, software <br>
modifications, system testing, documentation, etc., and any <br>
other activity required to facilitate the subsequent <br>
project implementation phase. Software may be purchased and <br>
modified, custom developed, or a combination of both,  to <br>
meet client requirements.<br>
<br>
Policy and Procedure manuals are developed to meet the <br>
specific needs of each client based on the users <br>
requirements and typically include all of the components <br>
required to administer corporate information and/or an <br>
independent data centre.<br>
<br>
SYSTEM INSTALLATION AND TRAINING <br>
Hardware and software systems are installed with a focus on <br>
technology transfer to the client.  Training programs are <br>
developed to meet the unique requirements of the client and <br>
include additional tasks and procedures as formulated and <br>
recommended by GCI.<br>

                            Stakeholder Cost Reporting (SCR) facilitates system user innovation from the point of data capture and validation, to the reporting of data and creation of business intelligence by:<br>
 providing meaningful information to different levels of the organization with the same data.  Tactical data, which is typically more granular in nature, is used at the operational level to drive operational efficiency, is simultaneously mapped to strategic data, which is used at the executive level to support long term corporate planning.<br>
 enabling a digital document strategy to minimize costs associated with manual paper records, systems, human resources and professional audit services.<br>
 creating a blue sky view of programs and projects as well as immediate access to detail including the originating source document. <br>
 establishing business process for corporate metrics to be captured and reported. The process is well documented and easy to maintain by people and requires little training. The process also creates a segregation of duties, authorization accountability, continuous audit trails and automatic tracking reports for individuals required to monitor and process tasks.   <br>
 impacting the ERP implementation strategy, by allowing smaller organizational units to adopt a Best of Breed  (BOB) application strategy, while improving value of the data provided to the ERP system. SCR facilitates BOB by ensuring that islands of data have a single source of data that is shared by all systems, including the data requirements of the corporate ERP system. ERP implementation ROI is improved by having ERP functionality at the core of the organization where change is minimal, while the BOB approach is implemented in the peripheral Business Units where change is rapid and continuous.<br>
 supporting a flat BU organizational structure with powerful reporting features to create a transparent team environment. When transparency is used with a well-defined business process, team politics are minimized and people tend to focus on their specific duties, which improves the performance of the whole team.<br>
 facilitating cost allocation techniques that are developed and consistently applied to deliver on the unique reporting requirements of every client stakeholder. <br>

A typical GCI project includes the following Project phases:<br>
I.	Requirements Analysis<br>
II.	Technology acquisition, modification, documentation<br>
III.	System installation and training<br>
<br>
REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS<br>
A comprehensive study thoroughly evaluates the clients&#39; <br>
objectives, requirements and allocated data management <br>
resources.  The study provides the client with a detailed <br>
report summarizing study findings, information technology <br>
strategy, recommendations, implementation plan, projected <br>
budget and related time frames.<br>
<br>
<br>
TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION, MODIFICATION AND DOCUMENTATION<br>
The primary focus of this project phase is development of <br>
Policy, Procedures and Software. Additional activities <br>
typically include asset acquisition, software <br>
modifications, system testing, documentation, etc., and any <br>
other activity required to facilitate the subsequent <br>
project implementation phase. Software may be purchased and <br>
modified, custom developed, or a combination of both,  to <br>
meet client requirements.<br>
<br>
Policy and Procedure manuals are developed to meet the <br>
specific needs of each client based on the users <br>
requirements and typically include all of the components <br>
required to administer corporate information and/or an <br>
independent data centre.<br>
<br>
SYSTEM INSTALLATION AND TRAINING <br>
Hardware and software systems are installed with a focus on <br>
technology transfer to the client.  Training programs are <br>
developed to meet the unique requirements of the client and <br>
include additional tasks and procedures as formulated and <br>
recommended by GCI.<br>
