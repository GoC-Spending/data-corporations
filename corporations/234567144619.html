                            LaserNett&#39;s welding services are second to none. Our state-of-the-art facilities include robotic welding for mass scale projects as well as MIG, TIG, Spot and Stud welding capabilities, where one of our fine craftsmen can weld together the perfect piece with impeccable attention to detail.<br>
<br>
<br>
Robotic Welding - Very high speed, extremely accurate, excellent repeatability, high strength. For very high volumes, where spot welding is not an option.<br>
<br>
MIG Welding- High speed, fairly accurate, high strength. For medium-high volume production welding. Aluminum, mild steel and stainless steel.<br>
<br>
TIG Welding - Low speed, extremely accurate, high strength; produces very presentable, high quality weld. For low volume and/or precision parts. Best choice for stainless steel and aluminum.<br>
<br>
Spot Welding - Extremely high speed, moderate accuracy, average strength. For very high volumes, but limited to specific applications.<br>
<br>
Stud Welding - Specialty welding technique for welding studs to plate in high volumes.<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;We, at Astra Design are very pleased with the business relationship we share with LaserNett. We have found the service to be always dependable, friendly and reliable over time of working together. LaserNett attention to detail and willingness to listen to our needs is extremely important to our company. This has enabled us to undertake projects with tight schedules with full confidence in their ability to meet our requirements in terms of quality, delivery and price. We have put LaserNett under pressure a numerous times and they have always risen to the challenge and never let us down. They are an extremely valued and important partner in our supply chain and commitment to the job means that we are free to focus on other parts of our projects. I would like to, personally express many thanks to the sales, engineering, production and accounting . Without you my life would be much more difficult.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to express our sincerest appreciation for the work that you have completed for RB&amp;W Corporation on numerous occasions.  It is very difficult to find a company like yourselves that has a demonstrated concern in meeting extremely tight dead-lines and focus to deliver a quality product. I admire the professionalism of your group in maintaining their composure while easing my concerns with the necessary confidence and resolve in finding solutions. I will openly provide recommendation for the services that your company has provided us and thank you once again for your commitment and quality of care.&quot; <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I just wanted to let you know how satisfied I am with the components that LaserNett has manufactured for us. The quality and consistency is excellent and also unparalleled customer service. It is such a relief to finally find a shop that can not only deliver a quality product at a reasonable price, but also deliver it on time. This has been a rarity for me in the eight years that I have been in production management and my dealings with many machine shops all over the province. It&#39;s nice to see that there are still some companies out there that take pride in their work and that are truly committed to their customers with a level of professionalism that is rarely seen these days. Great job! Please extend my appreciation to everyone that had a hand in the production of my parts. I presume that this is just the beginning of a long successful relationship between our companies.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We&#39;ve dealt with a number of laser shops and none can match the consistent quality and customer service provided by LaserNett. Marc and his team are a great asset to our business and they are far more than just another laser shop - they offer creative solutions when it comes to design and material selection and they will help make your new ideas come to life. If you are looking for a full service fabrication shop with outstanding communication look no further than LaserNett.&quot;

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;We, at Astra Design are very pleased with the business relationship we share with LaserNett. We have found the service to be always dependable, friendly and reliable over time of working together. LaserNett attention to detail and willingness to listen to our needs is extremely important to our company. This has enabled us to undertake projects with tight schedules with full confidence in their ability to meet our requirements in terms of quality, delivery and price. We have put LaserNett under pressure a numerous times and they have always risen to the challenge and never let us down. They are an extremely valued and important partner in our supply chain and commitment to the job means that we are free to focus on other parts of our projects. I would like to, personally express many thanks to the sales, engineering, production and accounting . Without you my life would be much more difficult.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to express our sincerest appreciation for the work that you have completed for RB&amp;W Corporation on numerous occasions.  It is very difficult to find a company like yourselves that has a demonstrated concern in meeting extremely tight dead-lines and focus to deliver a quality product. I admire the professionalism of your group in maintaining their composure while easing my concerns with the necessary confidence and resolve in finding solutions. I will openly provide recommendation for the services that your company has provided us and thank you once again for your commitment and quality of care.&quot; <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I just wanted to let you know how satisfied I am with the components that LaserNett has manufactured for us. The quality and consistency is excellent and also unparalleled customer service. It is such a relief to finally find a shop that can not only deliver a quality product at a reasonable price, but also deliver it on time. This has been a rarity for me in the eight years that I have been in production management and my dealings with many machine shops all over the province. It&#39;s nice to see that there are still some companies out there that take pride in their work and that are truly committed to their customers with a level of professionalism that is rarely seen these days. Great job! Please extend my appreciation to everyone that had a hand in the production of my parts. I presume that this is just the beginning of a long successful relationship between our companies.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We&#39;ve dealt with a number of laser shops and none can match the consistent quality and customer service provided by LaserNett. Marc and his team are a great asset to our business and they are far more than just another laser shop - they offer creative solutions when it comes to design and material selection and they will help make your new ideas come to life. If you are looking for a full service fabrication shop with outstanding communication look no further than LaserNett.&quot;
