natural shape ready for another blow. Contains: 1 sheet 12&quot; x 12&quot; <br>
in 1/4&quot;, 1/8&quot; and 3/8&quot; thicknesses. <br>

BIG MOUTH SQUEEZE BOTTLES <br>
Wide mouth opening makes filling with ice easy.  Medium density <br>
polyethylene provides a soft comfortable grip. Available with one <br>
piece lid/straw or a push/pull cap. Water-repellent carrying case <br>
included with 6-packs. Push/pull lids are more sanitary with a <br>
high volume flow design that allows the athlete to drink from the <br>
bottle without touching the receptacle, which reduces the risk of <br>
passing/receiving germs. <br>
<br>
CRAMER COOLER <br>
Features a seat-top locking lid, no drip spigot and recessed <br>
handles. With a minimum purchase of 12 cases of Quickick one <br>
gallon or 6 cases of Quickick five gallon, your dealer will give <br>
you a free 5 gallon cooler. Blue only. <br>
<br>
WIRE BOTTLE CARRIER <br>
Durable, vinyl-coated wire bottle carrier holds six quart-size <br>
squeeze bottles. Handle locks into place for stability, folds for <br>
storage. <br>
<br>
SQUEEZE BOTTLES <br>
The unrestricted straw in this polyethylene bottle yields a <br>
better flow, while sealed caps prevent leakage.  Water-repellent <br>
carrying case included with 6-packs. <br>
<br>
QUICKICK ELECTROLYTE DRINK <br>
Replaces lost electrolytes due to heavy sweating while  quenching <br>
thirst. Contains fructose, the all-natural,  nutritive sugar <br>
found in honey and a variety of fruits.  Triggers a slow rise in <br>
the blood sugar level to provide  longer lasting energy. <br>

                            Splints<br>
<br>
CRAMER AIR SPLINTS <br>
Orally inflatable. Zippered for fast application. Clear plastic <br>
allows observation of injury. Foot and leg splints have open-toe <br>
and open-zippered design for easier fitting. Also available; a <br>
sturdy water-proof vinyl case for transporting and storage. <br>
<br>
ORTHO FORM PADDING/SPLINTING MATERIAL <br>
Protect easy-to-bruise areas. Water activated, Ortho Form easily <br>
molds to any body part to provide rigid support and protection <br>
without the mess or time spent on &quot;glass or plaster&quot; systems. <br>
Attains 90% strength in just 5 minutes. At full-strength it is <br>
indestructible, yet remains soft, comforable and incredibly <br>
light. The polypropylene cover wicks away moisture to keep skin <br>
dry and odor free. It&#39;s also washable to last longer. Designed as <br>
a continuous roll in a dispenser box, Ortho Form reduces waste <br>
speeds sizing. In four widths, there&#39;s always the right size. <br>
<br>
UNIVERSAL SLING <br>
Plastic buckles adjust to any size and allow several <br>
configurations. Soft fabric helps prevent chafing and binding for <br>
immobilization with maximum comfort. <br>
<br>
SAM SPLINT <br>
Made of flexible aluminum with foam padding, Sam Splint gains <br>
rigidity as you form it. Weighs only 5.5 ounces. Flattens back <br>
out for re-use. <br>
<br>
RAPID FORM VACUUM IMMOBILIZER <br>
Patented Rapid Form stabilizes fractures and dislocations without <br>
circumferential pressure. Once secured around the injury, a pump <br>
extracts air. Inside, Styrofoam beads form a solid mass, making <br>
it rigid. All sets include pump, hose, attachment straps and <br>
carry bag. <br>

ORTHO FORM PADDING/SPLINTING MATERIAL <br>
Protect easy-to-bruise areas. Water activated, Ortho Form easily <br>
molds to any body part to provide rigid support and protection <br>
without the mess or time spent on &quot;glass or plaster&quot; systems. <br>
Attains 90% strength in just 5 minutes. At full-strength it is <br>
indestructible, yet remains soft, comforable and incredibly <br>
light. The polypropylene cover wicks away moisture to keep skin <br>
dry and odor free. It&#39;s also washable to last longer. Designed as <br>
a continuous roll in a dispenser box, Ortho Form reduces waste <br>
speeds sizing. In four widths, there&#39;s always the right size. <br>
<br>
UNIVERSAL SLING <br>
Plastic buckles adjust to any size and allow several <br>
configurations. Soft fabric helps prevent chafing and binding for <br>
immobilization with maximum comfort. <br>
<br>
SAM SPLINT <br>
Made of flexible aluminum with foam padding, Sam Splint gains <br>
rigidity as you form it. Weighs only 5.5 ounces. Flattens back <br>
out for re-use. <br>
<br>
RAPID FORM VACUUM IMMOBILIZER <br>
Patented Rapid Form stabilizes fractures and dislocations without <br>
circumferential pressure. Once secured around the injury, a pump <br>
extracts air. Inside, Styrofoam beads form a solid mass, making <br>
it rigid. All sets include pump, hose, attachment straps and <br>
carry bag. <br>
