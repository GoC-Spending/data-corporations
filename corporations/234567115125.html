Profiles International is actively servicing tens of thousands of clients around the world. Read on to see what some of our clients have to say. <br>
  <br>
Employee Turnover, Hiring, and Retention <br>
  <br>
  <br>
&quot;We screen applicants and then use the Step One Survey II. We specifically look at integrity, attitudes about substance abuse, reliability, and work ethic. Next, we go to the Profile XT, which helps with questions to ask in subsequent interviews. We&#39;ve used these products for a while and will revisit them in future recruiting.&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
- Kip Botkin, Highland Police Force <br>
  <br>
&quot;At one point we had a turnover rate of 40 percent. With the aid of the Profile XT and the Step One Survey II assessment, we&#39;ve reduced turnover to 29 percent. Based on the cost of replacing an employee, we have more than paid for the assessments.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Michael R. Teakell, SPHR <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company gets a good return on investment from the Profile XT assessment. We&#39;ve found the product crucial in helping us promote retention and enhance productivity. Your assessments are an important part of our HR tool kit.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Tom Rose and Allan Cantor, Sun Life Financial <br>
  <br>
&quot;A major benefit we continue to see is in the area of driver turnover. The American Trucking Association reported a national average of 109% turnover for medium sized carriers. Turnover for large carriers exceeded 130%. Our Vice President recently attended a trucking symposium sponsored by our insurance carrier. When we reported our 17% from last year, we were met with looks of great disbelief. Did the use of Profiles assessments alone cause 83% driver retention? Probably not, but no doubt, these tools were the main reason. This one benefit continues to save us thousands of dollars in recruitment and training costs.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- James Maloney, United Freight Service Inc.  <br>
  <br>
&quot;In the year we started using Profiles Internationals assessments, we decreased turnover by more than half. How? By using the tool to determine where a person fits best in our company. We are saving both time and money.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Glenda Smith, the Wizard&#39;s Cauldron <br>
  <br>
&quot;We use the Step One Survey to screen people before we hire. The Step One Survey II gives us more interview questions to use.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Gwen Frye, King Wholesale <br>
  <br>
&quot;Idaho Fish and Game has its share of baby boomers within our Conservation Officer ranks, and they are rapidly retiring. We have had to step up our recruitment efforts to fill our increased vacancies. We began looking at ways to identify those talents in our successful officers and find a mechanism to identify those traits in our candidates. We found what we were looking for when we were introduced to the Profile XT offered by Profiles International.<br>
<br>
We hired seven officers who have become known as the Magnificent Seven. Every one of them exhibits the behavioral traits identified in our Profiles XT Idaho Fish and Game Officer Job analysis. After two years, all seven continue to excel in their work and have set the bar higher for future recruits.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Jon Heggen, Idaho Fish and Game <br>
  <br>
&quot;We&#39;ve used the Profile XT and Step One Survey for retention and hiring. They help us pinpoint the right questions to ask people so we can find a better fit for the company. Our Client Services Representative is fabulous to work with and we have a good relationship.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Gambro <br>
  <br>
&quot;We wanted to reduce turnover of our designers. We used Profiles XT and made better hires. Bill Foster, our sales representative, did an outstanding job. He is very personable.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Ethan Allen Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our Bank was looking for additional tools to assist us in selecting the right applicants.   We use Profile XT, Step One Survey II, Profile Sales Indicator, and Customer Service Profile.   With these, we are better able to determine who is a good fit for the position and for our Bank. Our customer service representative has been very helpful in meeting our needs.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Hilltop National Bank <br>
  <br>
&quot;Since we started using Profiles Sales Indicator for pre-employment screening for sales employees, we&#39;ve been very happy. Because the test is online, we find it easy to use. We test all applicants and make better hiring decisions, giving us a better workforce. We are very happy with the service.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Lisa Garnet, Swedish Match North America <br>
  <br>
&quot;I guess one of the first things that come to mind is the fact that [Step One Survey II] is a measurable guide to determine that all our managers are following through in the same manner in regards to hiring. It also provides the follow up questions which make our Managers take the time to interact and really interview the person. I also like the fact that the questions are provided in a specific format that means we dont have to worry about them overstepping any lines of what can or cannot be asked! We have also found since using this tool it is a much better judge of honesty or integrity than when our managers relied on gut instinct! Easy to use and grade also comes to mind as a definite plus!&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Cindy Bartholomew, Pour Boy Oil Co <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Postal Credit Union wanted a product that would help find the best new people. We check aptitude with Step One Survey II. This tool narrows the selection to people who think the same way we do. Everyone at Profiles International is very helpful.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Tenita Howard, Postal Credit Union <br>
  <br>
&quot;We wanted to examine the potential ability of entry-level employees. For a while, we used Profile XT only. Now we are also using Step One Survey II. We discovered we could probe a candidate&#39;s interests more deeply. The assessments uncover traits and attitudes that would not normally have come up in our regular interviews. Everyone at Profiles International is very helpful and proactive.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Phil Buckleman, Alfa Laval Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;We have saved a great deal of money using Profiles International assessments because we haven&#39;t made a bad hiring choice. I like the variety of the assessments that we can use, and the option to specialize in different areas.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Jerry Hosko, Redi Carpet <br>
  <br>
&quot;By implementing the ProfileSelect system in combination with The Profile XT assessment tool, we are now able to quickly and accurately evaluate tens of thousands of candidates&#39; resumes each year. The AMS also provides us the ability to search this extensive database in seconds whereas the previous manual process was administratively onerous. And, the Profile XT assessment tool has allowed us to customize the tool&#39;s pattern to more accurately reflect a candidate&#39;s propensity for success with OUR jobs in OUR company.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Chuck LaMotte, White Lodging <br>
  <br>
&quot;Two recent hiring decisions made our managers feel very confident. They said they feel confident about their selection choices based on the use of the assessment. Your web site is awesome, very accessible and easy to use. And we can always find someone to answer our questions.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Alice Willmarth, The Mechanics Bank <br>
  <br>
&quot;I&#39;ve used the AMS recently while looking for full-time and adjunct faculty members. I think that the AMS is effective in keeping me informed of who is applying and what their status is throughout the application process. I especially like that I can make notes of scheduled interviews and notes about how those interviews went. I find the AMS much more effective and efficient than shuffling paperwork or talking on the phone. At this point, I haven&#39;t had any negative experiences with the AMS.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Amy Patrick, Senior Instructor, Department Chair<br>
English Department, Technical Communications Technology<br>
Texas State Technical College <br>
  <br>
&quot;In a short time, the assessment we purchased from ProfilesInternational paid for itself because we hired the right people and didn&#39;t have to hire again and retrain. We like the ability to assess people without making them feel uncomfortable. Your tools provide great insight and allow me to put people in the right position.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Dave LeBlanc, The Boiling Pot <br>
  <br>
&quot;We just went through the Profiles International assessment process to look for a supervisor. We found someone who is doing a great job. Your customer service is good. I never have to wait for a response.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Linda Burgess, Boring Specialties <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profile XT assessment helps us in recruiting. We like this tool to find applicants that fit. Dwight Crain, our Client Service Advisor has been very helpful.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Cottingham, Butler and Sisco <br>
  <br>
Over a three and half year period, our company&#39;s turnover was reduced by 49 percent, because we used the Step One Survey II. The savings we realized by hiring fewer people saved us almost a quarter of a million dollars.<br>
<br>
We started using Step One Survey in January 2001. The first year, turnover was high. The second and third years, it dropped substantially. Overall, we hired 33 percent fewer employees. We calculate that turnover costs $7,100 per employee. Since we hired 35 fewer people in 2002 and 2003, we saved $248,500.<br>
 <br>
- Rhonda Griffin, Centro, Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;I&#39;ve been receiving very important feedback from the Step One SurveyTM screening program. It has enabled me to learn insightful information prior to employment about an individuals attitudes as they relate to honesty/integrity, substance abuse, reliability and work ethic that ordinarily wouldn&#39;t be discovered until after someone is employed  then it&#39;s too late! Also, the direct admission portion provides open-ended interview questions that make the interview more structured and effective.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Judie Posner, Human Resources Manager <br>
  <br>
&quot;Step One Survey II has proved to be a useful tool in gauging employee work ethic, integrity and propensity to substance abuse. We use the test as part of the interview process. The face-to-face interview, reference checks and Step One test all play equal roles in determining the success of a candidate. We have determined that Step One is very accurate in identifying potential problem areas.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Margo Stewart, Human Resources Manager <br>
  <br>
&quot;I wanted to take this opportunity to tell you how delighted we are with the Step One Survey. After interviewing over a dozen applicants we found the Step One Survey to be a useful inexpensive tool to help us screen applicants. The survey is beneficial for asking all the questions we should have and then suggesting follow up questions in areas that need more explanation.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Ed Boerman, President <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profile XT and Profiles Sales Indicator Assessment have enabled our company to benchmark the performance standards in our sales executives so that we can strive to hire the best most productive candidates in the shortest amount of time. It saves us about $45,000 each time we can avoid hiring the wrong person. In addition, the Internet application with onscreen administration, instant analysis and report generation makes administration very easy and efficient.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Howard Falkow, Director of Human Resources <br>
  <br>
&quot;In a small company it is absolutely essential that the incoming people have the character and temperament to fit in. Public Relations is pressurized enough without having to sort out internal staff and personality clashes caused by hiring people with the wrong fit. As a small company, I would now never consider hiring anyone without first running them through the Profile.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Ronnie Simpson, Managing Director <br>
  <br>
&quot;We have been using Profiles Assessments since 1993 and I want to compliment you and your company on the constant development of new products and the improvements you have made through the years. The Profile gives me information about our people that is not just &quot;on target,&quot; it hits the bulls-eye every time. Using The Profile, we are improving productivity and the efficiency of every employee. It is an incredibly effective tool that I wholeheartedly endorse and recommend.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- James M.D. Maloney, President  <br>
  <br>
&quot;We used Profiles&#39; Sales Indicator assessment to help us place new salespeople and coach people already on staff. The tools help us to understand behavioral styles. The hiring products are very helpful. Ron Cerceo, our Client Service Advisor, was attentive and supportive with both individual assessments and large groups of salespeople.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- The Sales Factor <br>
  <br>
&quot;We wanted to do two things: screen new applicants, and gain expertise in identifying job fit for incumbents. We used Profile XT as a part of our hiring process to determine needs for management. Dwight Crain is awesome, and Anthony Pantaleone in New Jersey is outstanding. Our satisfaction with these two account managers is way above average.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Brown Shoprite <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company uses all the assessments. We want to know if applicants are knowledgeable in their trade. The results are key in helping us determine whether to offer a job. Your products are good.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Jason Benjamin, AAC Gardner Air Conditioning <br>
  <br>
&quot;We&#39;ve created a consistent model that fits our needs in using Profile XT to recruit new employees. Your assessments are easy to use and everyone is accommodating.&quot;<br>

&quot;We use Sales Indicator and Checkpoint 360 to help evaluate personnel. We are trying to make sure the people we hire have the right skills for the job.

Job Fit  <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company wanted to match sales representatives to the job, so we used the Profile XT. It scores the job candidates within the realm of what managers are seeking, and helps us make the right decision. Our Client Services Representative was always there when we needed her.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Lil Eikenburg, Advanstar <br>
  <br>
  <br>
&quot;Profile XT helps us get a grip on employee turnover. The assessment also helps us get people in the right job. Since using Profile XT, we&#39;ve decreased turnover in certain areas. We have no complaints and found Profiles&#39; training very useful.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Misti Merriam, National American University <br>
  <br>

Professional and Leadership Development  <br>

 <br>
- Kim Raap, St. Ambrose University <br>
  <br>
&quot;We find Checkpoint 360 helpful in leadership development. The assessment aids us in identifying strengths and weaknesses.&quot;<br>
 <br>

&quot;Profiles XT and Checkpoint 360 are the products we like to use for leadership development. These tools give participants insight into their own skills.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Michelle Hirsch, Whole Foods Market <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Checkpoint 360 assessment saves us one-on-one time with our managers. We promote leadership, and the assessments help us to emphasize how to be a leader without repeating it. We get better results and we&#39;re saving money, too.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Cassy Claude, Wink Inc <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company always uses the Performance Indicator when hiring new doctors. We&#39;ve used it hundreds of times to identify whether or not a doctor has the right personality for the job. Now we encourage the company to use it for other leadership positions. Everyone at Profiles has been a joy to work with. Kudos to the company!&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Richard Nicely, Dental One <br>
  <br>
Team Building <br>
  <br>
&quot;Profiles International is first-rate. We are in our third year of using your assessments. In the first year, we replaced every manager, then asked Profiles to step in and help us &#39;align our compass&#39; with their assessments. Profiles helped us build a team that, for the first time, shares priorities and a focus. And our people are enthusiastic about taking the test -- no more apprehension.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Patrick Adams, Brazos River Authority <br>
  <br>
&quot;Since we started using the Profile XT assessment, we&#39;ve not made any &#39;wrong&#39; hiring decisions. Our employees fit well into their teams and show job satisfaction. The tool helps us 100 percent.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Ann Freeman, First National Bank and Trust <br>
  <br>
&quot;We used the assessments when hiring 141 people in the 18 months after implementing. The end result: An incredible 99.3 percent score in terms of identifying and hiring productive and retainable team members. We find Profiles International and its products tremendously helpful in showing us how to guard our key assets -- our people.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Michael Owens, VHI Healthcare <br>
  <br>
&quot;Profiles Team Analysis pinpointed exactly the same challenges as were demonstrated during the teams existence. Had we known before, what we learned after the fact, these teams ability to perform effectively could have been greatly enhanced. As it was, they threatened themselves from within. With a few minor changes, significantly greater performance could have been realized.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- G. Benson Lange, Director of Engineering, Griffin International <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profiles Performance Indicator and Profiles Team Analysis gave our leaders and team members clear, measurable team behaviors to increase personal and team effectiveness. In addition, Robertas collaboration on measuring the bottom line impact of our team building created clear measures on increasing team performance.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Martin Woodrow, Director, KLA-Tencor Corporation<br>
 <br>
  <br>
Training and Development  <br>
  <br>
&quot;We recently used the Customer Service Profile as a training tool to help our existing staff better understand their strengths and weaknesses. I found the Survey most helpful in identifying areas that our team members both excel at and can use additional training.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Aimee Hathaway, Human Resources Manager <br>
  <br>
&quot;We attribute our increased hiring confidence to Profiles Internationals assessments. Small companies like ours especially need to hire the right person for each job. We save time by training the right people for our company. The assessments give a clear and accurate profile of potential candidates. Our new employees match their job perfectly. Your tools keep us on target.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Pat Simon, Lehigh Valley PBS <br>
  <br>
&quot;We are using Profile XT to help us with retention and training. The assessment takes a lot of things into consideration. We want to know if our employees are interested in moving up, and if their aptitude fits the position. We want to know where they might have problems. We adore our Client Services Representative .&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Sarah Monley, Carmel Partners <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Checkpoint 360 is the best product in this category that I&#39;ve used. As you know, this tool replaced another product that we had been using exclusively for almost two years. The managers and executives at Spectrum Healthcare Services (SHS) receive more valuable information in an easy to read, color-coded format, which encompasses everyone&#39;s individual learning style. Not only is there validated feedback, but a comprehensive action plan that each person may use to implement change, based on the facts from their customized report.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Patricia L. Keeley, Director, Training and Development <br>
  <br>
&quot;We have had extremely positive feedback from participants about the complete and detailed input they receive in their Individual Feedback Report. The data is colorfully presented in multiple formats so that participants can view their management and team competencies first with a wide-angle lens and then progressively narrow the focus all the way down to the survey item level.&quot;<br>

Profiles International Customer Service  <br>
  <br>
&quot;I have used Profiles for the last 10 years, including several years at two other companies. I brought Profiles tools with me when I changed jobs. I&#39;ve never had a problem getting in touch with my account manager. She&#39;s provided two &#39;webinars,&#39; which worked really well, and is always willing to do things at the last minute. I would rate Profiles&#39; overall service a 10 -- and I have always felt that way.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Karen Campion, Minnesota Diversified <br>
  <br>
&quot;The assessments are a good benefit that we didn&#39;t use previously. It has provided good information. My account manager resolves any technical problems quickly and also helps me interpret the results.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Joan McVaugh, Laboratory Testing Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;We really like the way the reports are put together and the information they provide us. We get solid information from the layout you use to display the results and the suggestions the reports offer.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Cassy Claude, Wink Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;I&#39;ve used Profiles for six years. The web site is very user friendly and it allows me to access to the results fast and easy. Profiles International assessments are extremely effective and accurate. Also Dwight Crain, our customer service representative has provided me with excellent assistance. He knows his customers and their company&#39;s needs. He is also able to answer questions and returns phone call quickly.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- The Woodlands <br>
  <br>
&quot;Your team is easily accessible. My account executive solves all my problems immediately. And the training we got on the assessments was great. Our trainer was very patient and didn&#39;t try to rush us through.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Judy Young, Westminster-Canterbury Richmond <br>
  <br>
&quot;Your business seems so personal. I feel as if I know my account manager, although I have never met him in person.

 <br>
- Susan Maiden, Darlings Auto Group <br>
  <br>

 <br>

  <br>
&quot;Profiles Internationals quick turnaround gives me the ability to get things done. Our president questioned a couple of reports and asked me to get back to him. Dwight Crain, our Client Service Advisor, was able to prepare a profile for us that day. He delivers rapid responses.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Darrel Tyree, ROM Corp. <br>
  <br>
&quot;We really like working with Dwight Crain, our Client Service Advisor. He is very responsive and always has backup when he is away. I had difficulty receiving an assessment, and the service team was right there until we got the problem fixed. They were great.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Jami Dittmeier, Middleburg Financial Corp. <br>

&quot;Our company always uses the Performance Indicator when hiring new doctors. We&#39;ve used it hundreds of times to identify whether or not a doctor has the right personality for the job. Now we encourage the company to use it for other leadership positions. Everyone at Profiles has been a joy to work with. Kudos to the company!&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Dental One  <br>
  <br>
&quot;We screen applicants and then use the Step One Survey. We specifically look at integrity, attitudes about substance abuse, reliability, and work ethic. Next, we go to the Profile XT, which helps with questions to ask in subsequent interviews. We&#39;ve used these products for a while and will revisit them in future recruiting.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Highland Police Force <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company uses all the assessments. We want to know if applicants are knowledgeable in their trade. The results are key in helping us determine whether to offer a job. Your products are good.&quot;<br>

 <br>
- Snaps, Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;London Transit Commission has used the subject products for approximately three years. We would recommend the products for a number of reasons:<br>
<br>
Ease of Administration- on-line entry and administration of the products makes use simple and easy and report generation timely<br>
  <br>
Ease of Understanding Reports- the reports are useful to us in terms of ease of interpretation and fit with our existing practices with respect to recruitment /selection and employee development<br>
  <br>
Underlying Logic- the products are well conceived and incorporate up-to-date approaches. As the result, we can use these as off the shelf products avoiding the necessity of developing more costly custom solutions. The products do allow us to identify things such as which skills are more important to our business than others. Both products provide advice through written commentary on reports which can be easily incorporated into our processes, adding value at reasonable cost. Reports such as the Organizational Management Analysis report which is available in conjunction with the Checkpoint 360s is useful to senior management in providing a more global analysis on management development needs <br>
London Transit Commission has had favourable experience with the products, and they have become an important part of the recruitment/selection and development processes here, allowing us to attain our human resource objectives.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Andy Hynes, W.A. Gilbert &amp; Associates <br>
  <br>
&quot;By having all of us complete the Profile XT Job Analysis Questionnaire, we were able to agree on the key skills required for recruiting our new Executive Director. This tool became invaluable when we compared the candidates background to the profile established for the position. <br>
<br>
The Check Point 360 Assessment is also a valuable tool. The method of gathering group feedback and creating a forum for discussion benefits both the employee and the organization.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Marlena Myers, Children in Crisis, Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profile XT is powerful and dynamic management tool that helps them place each individual in the job for which they are best suited, and helps ensure TAG can provide maximum safety and service to its clients. <br>
<br>
We have found these analytical tools to be much more effective than the standard résumé plus a buddys letter of recommendation, to help ensure that TAG hires pilots who should be.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Robert Tyler, TAG Aviation USA <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profile XT is a regular part of our recruitment process. This assessment is highly beneficial in our selection of quality candidates. We think it is tremendous! <br>
<br>
I have presented information on Checkpoint 360 product to our President and CEO.<br>
<br>
Both were very impressed with this assessment and asked that I move forward in implementing Checkpoint 360 as quickly as possible.&quot;<br>
 <br>

Profiles International is actively servicing tens of thousands of clients around the world. Read on to see what some of our clients have to say. <br>
  <br>
Employee Turnover, Hiring, and Retention <br>
  <br>
  <br>
&quot;We screen applicants and then use the Step One Survey II. We specifically look at integrity, attitudes about substance abuse, reliability, and work ethic. Next, we go to the Profile XT, which helps with questions to ask in subsequent interviews. We&#39;ve used these products for a while and will revisit them in future recruiting.&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
- Kip Botkin, Highland Police Force <br>
  <br>
&quot;At one point we had a turnover rate of 40 percent. With the aid of the Profile XT and the Step One Survey II assessment, we&#39;ve reduced turnover to 29 percent. Based on the cost of replacing an employee, we have more than paid for the assessments.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Michael R. Teakell, SPHR <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company gets a good return on investment from the Profile XT assessment. We&#39;ve found the product crucial in helping us promote retention and enhance productivity. Your assessments are an important part of our HR tool kit.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Tom Rose and Allan Cantor, Sun Life Financial <br>
  <br>
&quot;A major benefit we continue to see is in the area of driver turnover. The American Trucking Association reported a national average of 109% turnover for medium sized carriers. Turnover for large carriers exceeded 130%. Our Vice President recently attended a trucking symposium sponsored by our insurance carrier. When we reported our 17% from last year, we were met with looks of great disbelief. Did the use of Profiles assessments alone cause 83% driver retention? Probably not, but no doubt, these tools were the main reason. This one benefit continues to save us thousands of dollars in recruitment and training costs.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- James Maloney, United Freight Service Inc.  <br>
  <br>
&quot;In the year we started using Profiles Internationals assessments, we decreased turnover by more than half. How? By using the tool to determine where a person fits best in our company. We are saving both time and money.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Glenda Smith, the Wizard&#39;s Cauldron <br>
  <br>
&quot;We use the Step One Survey to screen people before we hire. The Step One Survey II gives us more interview questions to use.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Gwen Frye, King Wholesale <br>
  <br>
&quot;Idaho Fish and Game has its share of baby boomers within our Conservation Officer ranks, and they are rapidly retiring. We have had to step up our recruitment efforts to fill our increased vacancies. We began looking at ways to identify those talents in our successful officers and find a mechanism to identify those traits in our candidates. We found what we were looking for when we were introduced to the Profile XT offered by Profiles International.<br>
<br>
We hired seven officers who have become known as the Magnificent Seven. Every one of them exhibits the behavioral traits identified in our Profiles XT Idaho Fish and Game Officer Job analysis. After two years, all seven continue to excel in their work and have set the bar higher for future recruits.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Jon Heggen, Idaho Fish and Game <br>
  <br>
&quot;We&#39;ve used the Profile XT and Step One Survey for retention and hiring. They help us pinpoint the right questions to ask people so we can find a better fit for the company. Our Client Services Representative is fabulous to work with and we have a good relationship.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Gambro <br>
  <br>
&quot;We wanted to reduce turnover of our designers. We used Profiles XT and made better hires. Bill Foster, our sales representative, did an outstanding job. He is very personable.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Ethan Allen Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our Bank was looking for additional tools to assist us in selecting the right applicants.   We use Profile XT, Step One Survey II, Profile Sales Indicator, and Customer Service Profile.   With these, we are better able to determine who is a good fit for the position and for our Bank. Our customer service representative has been very helpful in meeting our needs.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Hilltop National Bank <br>
  <br>
&quot;Since we started using Profiles Sales Indicator for pre-employment screening for sales employees, we&#39;ve been very happy. Because the test is online, we find it easy to use. We test all applicants and make better hiring decisions, giving us a better workforce. We are very happy with the service.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Lisa Garnet, Swedish Match North America <br>
  <br>
&quot;I guess one of the first things that come to mind is the fact that [Step One Survey II] is a measurable guide to determine that all our managers are following through in the same manner in regards to hiring. It also provides the follow up questions which make our Managers take the time to interact and really interview the person. I also like the fact that the questions are provided in a specific format that means we dont have to worry about them overstepping any lines of what can or cannot be asked! We have also found since using this tool it is a much better judge of honesty or integrity than when our managers relied on gut instinct! Easy to use and grade also comes to mind as a definite plus!&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Cindy Bartholomew, Pour Boy Oil Co <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Postal Credit Union wanted a product that would help find the best new people. We check aptitude with Step One Survey II. This tool narrows the selection to people who think the same way we do. Everyone at Profiles International is very helpful.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Tenita Howard, Postal Credit Union <br>
  <br>
&quot;We wanted to examine the potential ability of entry-level employees. For a while, we used Profile XT only. Now we are also using Step One Survey II. We discovered we could probe a candidate&#39;s interests more deeply. The assessments uncover traits and attitudes that would not normally have come up in our regular interviews. Everyone at Profiles International is very helpful and proactive.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Phil Buckleman, Alfa Laval Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;We have saved a great deal of money using Profiles International assessments because we haven&#39;t made a bad hiring choice. I like the variety of the assessments that we can use, and the option to specialize in different areas.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Jerry Hosko, Redi Carpet <br>
  <br>
&quot;By implementing the ProfileSelect system in combination with The Profile XT assessment tool, we are now able to quickly and accurately evaluate tens of thousands of candidates&#39; resumes each year. The AMS also provides us the ability to search this extensive database in seconds whereas the previous manual process was administratively onerous. And, the Profile XT assessment tool has allowed us to customize the tool&#39;s pattern to more accurately reflect a candidate&#39;s propensity for success with OUR jobs in OUR company.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Chuck LaMotte, White Lodging <br>
  <br>
&quot;Two recent hiring decisions made our managers feel very confident. They said they feel confident about their selection choices based on the use of the assessment. Your web site is awesome, very accessible and easy to use. And we can always find someone to answer our questions.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Alice Willmarth, The Mechanics Bank <br>
  <br>
&quot;I&#39;ve used the AMS recently while looking for full-time and adjunct faculty members. I think that the AMS is effective in keeping me informed of who is applying and what their status is throughout the application process. I especially like that I can make notes of scheduled interviews and notes about how those interviews went. I find the AMS much more effective and efficient than shuffling paperwork or talking on the phone. At this point, I haven&#39;t had any negative experiences with the AMS.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Amy Patrick, Senior Instructor, Department Chair<br>
English Department, Technical Communications Technology<br>
Texas State Technical College <br>
  <br>
&quot;In a short time, the assessment we purchased from ProfilesInternational paid for itself because we hired the right people and didn&#39;t have to hire again and retrain. We like the ability to assess people without making them feel uncomfortable. Your tools provide great insight and allow me to put people in the right position.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Dave LeBlanc, The Boiling Pot <br>
  <br>
&quot;We just went through the Profiles International assessment process to look for a supervisor. We found someone who is doing a great job. Your customer service is good. I never have to wait for a response.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Linda Burgess, Boring Specialties <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profile XT assessment helps us in recruiting. We like this tool to find applicants that fit. Dwight Crain, our Client Service Advisor has been very helpful.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Cottingham, Butler and Sisco <br>
  <br>
Over a three and half year period, our company&#39;s turnover was reduced by 49 percent, because we used the Step One Survey II. The savings we realized by hiring fewer people saved us almost a quarter of a million dollars.<br>
<br>
We started using Step One Survey in January 2001. The first year, turnover was high. The second and third years, it dropped substantially. Overall, we hired 33 percent fewer employees. We calculate that turnover costs $7,100 per employee. Since we hired 35 fewer people in 2002 and 2003, we saved $248,500.<br>
 <br>
- Rhonda Griffin, Centro, Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;I&#39;ve been receiving very important feedback from the Step One SurveyTM screening program. It has enabled me to learn insightful information prior to employment about an individuals attitudes as they relate to honesty/integrity, substance abuse, reliability and work ethic that ordinarily wouldn&#39;t be discovered until after someone is employed  then it&#39;s too late! Also, the direct admission portion provides open-ended interview questions that make the interview more structured and effective.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Judie Posner, Human Resources Manager <br>
  <br>
&quot;Step One Survey II has proved to be a useful tool in gauging employee work ethic, integrity and propensity to substance abuse. We use the test as part of the interview process. The face-to-face interview, reference checks and Step One test all play equal roles in determining the success of a candidate. We have determined that Step One is very accurate in identifying potential problem areas.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Margo Stewart, Human Resources Manager <br>
  <br>
&quot;I wanted to take this opportunity to tell you how delighted we are with the Step One Survey. After interviewing over a dozen applicants we found the Step One Survey to be a useful inexpensive tool to help us screen applicants. The survey is beneficial for asking all the questions we should have and then suggesting follow up questions in areas that need more explanation.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Ed Boerman, President <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profile XT and Profiles Sales Indicator Assessment have enabled our company to benchmark the performance standards in our sales executives so that we can strive to hire the best most productive candidates in the shortest amount of time. It saves us about $45,000 each time we can avoid hiring the wrong person. In addition, the Internet application with onscreen administration, instant analysis and report generation makes administration very easy and efficient.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Howard Falkow, Director of Human Resources <br>
  <br>
&quot;In a small company it is absolutely essential that the incoming people have the character and temperament to fit in. Public Relations is pressurized enough without having to sort out internal staff and personality clashes caused by hiring people with the wrong fit. As a small company, I would now never consider hiring anyone without first running them through the Profile.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Ronnie Simpson, Managing Director <br>
  <br>
&quot;We have been using Profiles Assessments since 1993 and I want to compliment you and your company on the constant development of new products and the improvements you have made through the years. The Profile gives me information about our people that is not just &quot;on target,&quot; it hits the bulls-eye every time. Using The Profile, we are improving productivity and the efficiency of every employee. It is an incredibly effective tool that I wholeheartedly endorse and recommend.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- James M.D. Maloney, President  <br>
  <br>
&quot;We used Profiles&#39; Sales Indicator assessment to help us place new salespeople and coach people already on staff. The tools help us to understand behavioral styles. The hiring products are very helpful. Ron Cerceo, our Client Service Advisor, was attentive and supportive with both individual assessments and large groups of salespeople.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- The Sales Factor <br>
  <br>
&quot;We wanted to do two things: screen new applicants, and gain expertise in identifying job fit for incumbents. We used Profile XT as a part of our hiring process to determine needs for management. Dwight Crain is awesome, and Anthony Pantaleone in New Jersey is outstanding. Our satisfaction with these two account managers is way above average.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Brown Shoprite <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company uses all the assessments. We want to know if applicants are knowledgeable in their trade. The results are key in helping us determine whether to offer a job. Your products are good.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Jason Benjamin, AAC Gardner Air Conditioning <br>
  <br>
&quot;We&#39;ve created a consistent model that fits our needs in using Profile XT to recruit new employees. Your assessments are easy to use and everyone is accommodating.&quot;<br>

Profile XT aids us in choosing the best candidates for our open positions. We think Jennifer Smith, our client services representative, of Profiles International, is wonderful. She is so responsive! <br>
 <br>
- Denise Shreck, Domnick Hunter <br>
  <br>
&quot;We use Sales Indicator and Checkpoint 360 to help evaluate personnel. We are trying to make sure the people we hire have the right skills for the job. The assessments also give us an idea of the support our new employees need. It helps us look at weaknesses and other traits, and puts in place the tools to support the people we hire. Our client services representative, Jennifer Smith, does a great job. She has responded every time we&#39;ve needed her.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  <br>
- Tomme Stevenson, Snaps, Inc. <br>
  <br>
Job Fit  <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company wanted to match sales representatives to the job, so we used the Profile XT. It scores the job candidates within the realm of what managers are seeking, and helps us make the right decision. Our Client Services Representative was always there when we needed her.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Lil Eikenburg, Advanstar <br>
  <br>
  <br>
&quot;Profile XT helps us get a grip on employee turnover. The assessment also helps us get people in the right job. Since using Profile XT, we&#39;ve decreased turnover in certain areas. We have no complaints and found Profiles&#39; training very useful.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Misti Merriam, National American University <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our credit union looked for applicants that matched exactly what we wanted in a prospect. We use Profile XT, which helps in placement. These tools give us more information about prospective employees. Ron Cerceo is always helpful.&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
- Karen Doyle, Colorado State Employees Credit Union <br>
  <br>
Professional and Leadership Development  <br>
  <br>
&quot;We use the Checkpoint 360 with doctors and nurses. It has proved beneficial. Ron Cerceo, our Client Service Advisor, is very knowledgeable and most helpful in answering questions.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Kim Raap, St. Ambrose University <br>
  <br>
&quot;We find Checkpoint 360 helpful in leadership development. The assessment aids us in identifying strengths and weaknesses.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Rita Knowles, Holy Family Memorial Hospital <br>
  <br>
&quot;Profiles XT and Checkpoint 360 are the products we like to use for leadership development. These tools give participants insight into their own skills.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Michelle Hirsch, Whole Foods Market <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Checkpoint 360 assessment saves us one-on-one time with our managers. We promote leadership, and the assessments help us to emphasize how to be a leader without repeating it. We get better results and we&#39;re saving money, too.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Cassy Claude, Wink Inc <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company always uses the Performance Indicator when hiring new doctors. We&#39;ve used it hundreds of times to identify whether or not a doctor has the right personality for the job. Now we encourage the company to use it for other leadership positions. Everyone at Profiles has been a joy to work with. Kudos to the company!&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Richard Nicely, Dental One <br>
  <br>
Team Building <br>
  <br>
&quot;Profiles International is first-rate. We are in our third year of using your assessments. In the first year, we replaced every manager, then asked Profiles to step in and help us &#39;align our compass&#39; with their assessments. Profiles helped us build a team that, for the first time, shares priorities and a focus. And our people are enthusiastic about taking the test -- no more apprehension.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Patrick Adams, Brazos River Authority <br>
  <br>
&quot;Since we started using the Profile XT assessment, we&#39;ve not made any &#39;wrong&#39; hiring decisions. Our employees fit well into their teams and show job satisfaction. The tool helps us 100 percent.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Ann Freeman, First National Bank and Trust <br>
  <br>
&quot;We used the assessments when hiring 141 people in the 18 months after implementing. The end result: An incredible 99.3 percent score in terms of identifying and hiring productive and retainable team members. We find Profiles International and its products tremendously helpful in showing us how to guard our key assets -- our people.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Michael Owens, VHI Healthcare <br>
  <br>
&quot;Profiles Team Analysis pinpointed exactly the same challenges as were demonstrated during the teams existence. Had we known before, what we learned after the fact, these teams ability to perform effectively could have been greatly enhanced. As it was, they threatened themselves from within. With a few minor changes, significantly greater performance could have been realized.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- G. Benson Lange, Director of Engineering, Griffin International <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profiles Performance Indicator and Profiles Team Analysis gave our leaders and team members clear, measurable team behaviors to increase personal and team effectiveness. In addition, Robertas collaboration on measuring the bottom line impact of our team building created clear measures on increasing team performance.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Martin Woodrow, Director, KLA-Tencor Corporation<br>
 <br>
  <br>
Training and Development  <br>
  <br>
&quot;We recently used the Customer Service Profile as a training tool to help our existing staff better understand their strengths and weaknesses. I found the Survey most helpful in identifying areas that our team members both excel at and can use additional training.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Aimee Hathaway, Human Resources Manager <br>

&quot;We attribute our increased hiring confidence to Profiles Internationals assessments. Small companies like ours especially need to hire the right person for each job. We save time by training the right people for our company. The assessments give a clear and accurate profile of potential candidates. Our new employees match their job perfectly. Your tools keep us on target.&quot; <br>
 <br>
- Pat Simon, Lehigh Valley PBS <br>
  <br>
&quot;We are using Profile XT to help us with retention and training. The assessment takes a lot of things into consideration. We want to know if our employees are interested in moving up, and if their aptitude fits the position. We want to know where they might have problems. We adore our Client Services Representative .&quot;<br>

  <br>
&quot;The Checkpoint 360 is the best product in this category that I&#39;ve used. As you know, this tool replaced another product that we had been using exclusively for almost two years. The managers and executives at Spectrum Healthcare Services (SHS) receive more valuable information in an easy to read, color-coded format, which encompasses everyone&#39;s individual learning style. Not only is there validated feedback, but a comprehensive action plan that each person may use to implement change, based on the facts from their customized report.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Patricia L. Keeley, Director, Training and Development <br>
  <br>
&quot;We have had extremely positive feedback from participants about the complete and detailed input they receive in their Individual Feedback Report. The data is colorfully presented in multiple formats so that participants can view their management and team competencies first with a wide-angle lens and then progressively narrow the focus all the way down to the survey item level.&quot;<br>

Profiles International Customer Service  <br>
  <br>
&quot;I have used Profiles for the last 10 years, including several years at two other companies. I brought Profiles tools with me when I changed jobs. I&#39;ve never had a problem getting in touch with my account manager. She&#39;s provided two &#39;webinars,&#39; which worked really well, and is always willing to do things at the last minute. I would rate Profiles&#39; overall service a 10 -- and I have always felt that way.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Karen Campion, Minnesota Diversified <br>
  <br>
&quot;The assessments are a good benefit that we didn&#39;t use previously. It has provided good information. My account manager resolves any technical problems quickly and also helps me interpret the results.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Joan McVaugh, Laboratory Testing Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;We really like the way the reports are put together and the information they provide us. We get solid information from the layout you use to display the results and the suggestions the reports offer.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Cassy Claude, Wink Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;I&#39;ve used Profiles for six years. The web site is very user friendly and it allows me to access to the results fast and easy. Profiles International assessments are extremely effective and accurate. Also Dwight Crain, our customer service representative has provided me with excellent assistance. He knows his customers and their company&#39;s needs. He is also able to answer questions and returns phone call quickly.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- The Woodlands <br>
  <br>
&quot;Your team is easily accessible. My account executive solves all my problems immediately. And the training we got on the assessments was great. Our trainer was very patient and didn&#39;t try to rush us through.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Judy Young, Westminster-Canterbury Richmond <br>
  <br>
&quot;Your business seems so personal. I feel as if I know my account manager, although I have never met him in person. He is very responsive to my company&#39;s needs and does extra work to make sure deadlines are met or to get things done in a rush if necessary. Your products are user-friendly, too.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Susan Maiden, Darlings Auto Group <br>
  <br>
&quot;Thomas Barber, our Client Service Advisor, is excellent at helping us learn and use Profiles&#39; tools. We&#39;ve experienced no problems. Profiles International has provided the highest level of service to our company.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Ron Meredeith, Lamb&#39;s Tire and Auto <br>
  <br>
&quot;Ron Cerceo, our Client Service Advisor, returns our calls promptly and helps us through any difficulties. We are able to contact him easily. Profiles products have definitely aided us in the hiring process.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Cindy Robl, Devry-Denver <br>
  <br>
&quot;Profiles Internationals quick turnaround gives me the ability to get things done. Our president questioned a couple of reports and asked me to get back to him. Dwight Crain, our Client Service Advisor, was able to prepare a profile for us that day. He delivers rapid responses.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Darrel Tyree, ROM Corp. <br>
  <br>
&quot;We really like working with Dwight Crain, our Client Service Advisor. He is very responsive and always has backup when he is away. I had difficulty receiving an assessment, and the service team was right there until we got the problem fixed. They were great.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Jami Dittmeier, Middleburg Financial Corp. <br>
  <br>
&quot;We started using assessments six years ago. Ron Cerceo, our Client Service Advisor, has been more than helpful, very cooperative and accommodating. We can only say good things about him and Profiles International.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Dave Medved, Draper Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;My staff and I enjoy working with you and your company. Id also like to thank you for the great service you have given to our company. You make our hiring process much more efficient.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Pristine Mortgage <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company always uses the Performance Indicator when hiring new doctors. We&#39;ve used it hundreds of times to identify whether or not a doctor has the right personality for the job. Now we encourage the company to use it for other leadership positions. Everyone at Profiles has been a joy to work with. Kudos to the company!&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Dental One  <br>
  <br>
&quot;We screen applicants and then use the Step One Survey. We specifically look at integrity, attitudes about substance abuse, reliability, and work ethic. Next, we go to the Profile XT, which helps with questions to ask in subsequent interviews. We&#39;ve used these products for a while and will revisit them in future recruiting.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Highland Police Force <br>
  <br>
&quot;Our company uses all the assessments. We want to know if applicants are knowledgeable in their trade. The results are key in helping us determine whether to offer a job. Your products are good.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Gardner Air Conditioning <br>
  <br>
&quot;We&#39;ve created a consistent model that fits our needs in using Profile XT to recruit new employees. Your assessments are easy to use and everyone is accommodating.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- John Henry Foster Missouri <br>
  <br>
&quot;Profile XT aids us in choosing the best candidates for our open positions. Our client services representative is responsive and wonderful.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Domnick Hunter <br>
  <br>
&quot;We use Sales Indicator and Checkpoint 360 to help evaluate personnel. We are trying to make sure the people we hire have the right skills for the job. The assessments also give us an idea of the support our new employees need. It helps us look at weaknesses and other traits, and puts in place the tools to support the people we hire. Our client services representative does a great job and has responded every time we&#39;ve needed help.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Snaps, Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;London Transit Commission has used the subject products for approximately three years. We would recommend the products for a number of reasons:<br>
<br>
Ease of Administration- on-line entry and administration of the products makes use simple and easy and report generation timely<br>
  <br>
Ease of Understanding Reports- the reports are useful to us in terms of ease of interpretation and fit with our existing practices with respect to recruitment /selection and employee development<br>
  <br>
Underlying Logic- the products are well conceived and incorporate up-to-date approaches. As the result, we can use these as off the shelf products avoiding the necessity of developing more costly custom solutions. The products do allow us to identify things such as which skills are more important to our business than others. Both products provide advice through written commentary on reports which can be easily incorporated into our processes, adding value at reasonable cost. Reports such as the Organizational Management Analysis report which is available in conjunction with the Checkpoint 360s is useful to senior management in providing a more global analysis on management development needs <br>
London Transit Commission has had favourable experience with the products, and they have become an important part of the recruitment/selection and development processes here, allowing us to attain our human resource objectives.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Andy Hynes, W.A. Gilbert &amp; Associates <br>
  <br>
&quot;By having all of us complete the Profile XT Job Analysis Questionnaire, we were able to agree on the key skills required for recruiting our new Executive Director. This tool became invaluable when we compared the candidates background to the profile established for the position. <br>
<br>
The Check Point 360 Assessment is also a valuable tool. The method of gathering group feedback and creating a forum for discussion benefits both the employee and the organization.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Marlena Myers, Children in Crisis, Inc. <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profile XT is powerful and dynamic management tool that helps them place each individual in the job for which they are best suited, and helps ensure TAG can provide maximum safety and service to its clients. <br>
<br>
We have found these analytical tools to be much more effective than the standard résumé plus a buddys letter of recommendation, to help ensure that TAG hires pilots who should be.&quot;<br>
 <br>
- Robert Tyler, TAG Aviation USA <br>
  <br>
&quot;The Profile XT is a regular part of our recruitment process. This assessment is highly beneficial in our selection of quality candidates. We think it is tremendous! <br>
<br>
I have presented information on Checkpoint 360 product to our President and CEO.<br>
<br>
Both were very impressed with this assessment and asked that I move forward in implementing Checkpoint 360 as quickly as possible.&quot;<br>
