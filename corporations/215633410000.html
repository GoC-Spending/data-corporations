                            RWDI’s wind-engineering consultants provide expert advice for the design of structures affected by wind. The consulting expertise of RWDI’s engineers and scientists is based on decades of invaluable experience working on many of the world’s landmark structures using physical modeling and computational techniques.  Local wind loads are assessed for component and cladding design.<br>
<br>
Aerodynamic stability and structural wind loads are assessed for the design of main wind force resisting systems to mitigate predicted wind-induced motions and other potential issues.<br>

                            Commercial, healthcare and industrial facilities require highly efficient and reliable building or plant ventilation and exhaust systems. RWDI’s recommendations produce climate responsive designs that improve air movement and distribution and mitigate undesirables such as condensation on cold surfaces, exposure of occupants to hazardous contaminants, and stack effect.<br>
<br>
RWDI&#39;s total service package includes review and evaluation, the design and specification of ventilation and exhaust systems, equipment start-up and monitoring.<br>

                            Undesirable fluctuating loads, localized vibrations, and overall dynamic response of structures are caused by wind, pedestrians, occupants, machinery, and earthquakes.<br>
<br>
Specific floor vibration issues can range from nanotechnology to human comfort.<br>
<br>
RWDI have devised innovative solutions for motion damping in tall structures and bridges and vibration control in laboratory, structural and industrial applications across the globe.<br>

                            Commercial, healthcare and industrial facilities require highly efficient and reliable building or plant ventilation and exhaust systems.<br>
<br>
RWDI’s recommendations produce climate responsive designs that improve air movement and distribution and mitigate undesirables such as condensation on cold surfaces, exposure of occupants to hazardous contaminants, and stack effect.<br>
<br>
RWDI&#39;s total service package includes review and evaluation, the design and specification of ventilation and exhaust systems, equipment start-up and monitoring.<br>

                            The optimum solution to acoustic and noise problems within and around a building or work site requires input from all relevant design team disciplines to achieve the more cost effective design.<br>
<br>
Noise and vibration can result in strained community relations, work refusals, and eventually regulatory actions.<br>
<br>
Regulatory agencies are paying increasing attention to potential impacts at the permitting stage.<br>
<br>
Aeroacoustic assessments address “whistling” or “humming” noise generated as winds flow through and around architectural features such as sunshades or fins.<br>

                            RWDI’s wind-engineering consultants provide expert advice for the design of structures affected by wind. The consulting expertise of RWDI’s engineers and scientists is based on decades of invaluable experience working on many of the world’s landmark structures using physical modeling and computational techniques.  Local wind loads are assessed for component and cladding design.<br>
<br>
Aerodynamic stability and structural wind loads are assessed for the design of main wind force resisting systems to mitigate predicted wind-induced motions and other potential issues.<br>

                            Commercial, healthcare and industrial facilities require highly efficient and reliable building or plant ventilation and exhaust systems. RWDI’s recommendations produce climate responsive designs that improve air movement and distribution and mitigate undesirables such as condensation on cold surfaces, exposure of occupants to hazardous contaminants, and stack effect.<br>
<br>
RWDI&#39;s total service package includes review and evaluation, the design and specification of ventilation and exhaust systems, equipment start-up and monitoring.<br>

                            Commercial, healthcare and industrial facilities require highly efficient and reliable building or plant ventilation and exhaust systems.<br>
<br>
RWDI’s recommendations produce climate responsive designs that improve air movement and distribution and mitigate undesirables such as condensation on cold surfaces, exposure of occupants to hazardous contaminants, and stack effect.<br>
<br>
RWDI&#39;s total service package includes review and evaluation, the design and specification of ventilation and exhaust systems, equipment start-up and monitoring.<br>

<br>
Situations include property transactions, operating permits, disposal of spoil or Phase I and II (CSA) type environmental assessments.<br>

                            The optimum solution to acoustic and noise problems within and around a building or work site requires input from all relevant design team disciplines to achieve the more cost effective design.<br>
<br>
Noise and vibration can result in strained community relations, work refusals, and eventually regulatory actions.<br>
<br>
Regulatory agencies are paying increasing attention to potential impacts at the permitting stage.<br>
<br>
Aeroacoustic assessments address “whistling” or “humming” noise generated as winds flow through and around architectural features such as sunshades or fins.<br>

                            RWDI&#39;s physical and computational testing capabilities allows for accurate predictions of the interaction of unique structures with the environmental stresses present at a particular geographical location.<br>
<br>
The safety and envronmental impact of structures such as landscape artworks, monuments or creative amusement park structures, can be mitigated by an early design consultation with our multi-disciplinary team of engineers and scientists.<br>
