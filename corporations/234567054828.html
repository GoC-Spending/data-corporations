              Dear Terri,<br>
<br>
I wanted to congratulate you on the superb series of seminars that you gave over the past few months for my employees.  <br>
<br>
Your energy, enthusiasm and most of all your sincerity is what shines through every word you speak.  What stands out the most is that you love what you do, have an understanding of what works with people and you were able to adapt and adjust to the various groups we had over the past several months.  <br>
<br>
With the new year approaching, we look forward to your seminars and will be booking several weekend workshops. <br>
<br>
I applaud your professionalism, integrity and dedication. <br>
<br>
Thanking you again for some life changing thoughts and you provided many of us with the road map to success!<br>

This letter is to express all my gratitude and luck to you!  There are special people that come and go in our lives for a purpose and from the moment you walked into the room for our training I felt it!   Like a role model you gave me and I am sure the entire group a positive vibe.  You confirmed to me that passion is what drives us to do our jobs well.  Most importantly, you reinforced the aspect of being human.  You fed my soul with your sincerity!   Amelie, Quebec<br>
Terri, your words inspired and motivated me to put into practice all the things you discussed at the seminar last week!  My colleagues and supervisor have all seen the benefits!  Thank you!   Johanne,   Montreal<br>

Comments from one client who went through career coaching <br>
<br>
From Franca, Montreal<br>
<br>
	Terri thanks for your energy and strong, motivating attitude.  I felt so much better tonight as a result of our session. I literally felt taller... if you can believe that...taller... Once that occurred to me, I realized that it was because I felt as though you&#39;d lifted me out of the dark.  I admit a place I have called home&#39; for way too long.  I love your feedback!  It&#39;s motivating and I feel my attitude shifting! Thank you!   <br>
<br>
<br>
	Thank you, Terri! You are a true inspiration on this quest and I cannot wait for the days, weeks and months ahead... to experience the yet-unknown treasures they contain!<br>
<br>
	I believe some beings that walk among us are like angels; there&#39;s an aura about them that is filled with goodness, lightness and positive energy that guides and inspires. I feel you are one of these people, Terri. As I read your last e-mail, here, I noticed a feeling of calm reassurance taking hold and it&#39;s like a guiding light and, wouldn&#39;t you know it...

              Dear Terri,<br>
<br>
I wanted to congratulate you on the superb series of seminars that you gave over the past few months for my employees.  <br>
<br>
Your energy, enthusiasm and most of all your sincerity is what shines through every word you speak.  What stands out the most is that you love what you do, have an understanding of what works with people and you were able to adapt and adjust to the various groups we had over the past several months.  <br>
<br>
With the new year approaching, we look forward to your seminars and will be booking several weekend workshops. <br>
<br>
I applaud your professionalism, integrity and dedication. <br>
<br>
Thanking you again for some life changing thoughts and you provided many of us with the road map to success!<br>

Thank you, so much!  I know we all have to do our job but some excel in theres and you do!    Gina, Eastern Townships, Quebec<br>
This letter is to express all my gratitude and luck to you!  There are special people that come and go in our lives for a purpose and from the moment you walked into the room for our training I felt it!   Like a role model you gave me and I am sure the entire group a positive vibe.  You confirmed to me that passion is what drives us to do our jobs well.  Most importantly, you reinforced the aspect of being human.  You fed my soul with your sincerity!   Amelie, Quebec<br>
Terri, your words inspired and motivated me to put into practice all the things you discussed at the seminar last week!  My colleagues and supervisor have all seen the benefits!  Thank you!   Johanne,   Montreal<br>

Comments from one client who went through career coaching <br>

From Franca, Montreal<br>
<br>
	Terri thanks for your energy and strong, motivating attitude.  I felt so much better tonight as a result of our session. I literally felt taller... if you can believe that...taller... Once that occurred to me, I realized that it was because I felt as though you&#39;d lifted me out of the dark.  I admit a place I have called home&#39; for way too long.  I love your feedback!  It&#39;s motivating and I feel my attitude shifting! Thank you!   <br>
<br>
<br>
	Thank you, Terri! You are a true inspiration on this quest and I cannot wait for the days, weeks and months ahead... to experience the yet-unknown treasures they contain!<br>
<br>
	I believe some beings that walk among us are like angels; there&#39;s an aura about them that is filled with goodness, lightness and positive energy that guides and inspires. I feel you are one of these people, Terri. As I read your last e-mail, here, I noticed a feeling of calm reassurance taking hold and it&#39;s like a guiding light and, wouldn&#39;t you know it...
