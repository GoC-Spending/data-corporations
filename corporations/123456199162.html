                            Transforming land into a residential or mixed-use community, or a public space with parks and trails, requires a mix of technical skill and creative vision, as well as insight into development. We merge this expertise to create value for our clients and community.<br>
<br>
Our clients rely on us to optimize the potential of their land. Our engineers, surveyors, and transportation experts lay the groundwork for infrastructure so a community can run smoothly. Our environmental scientists restore and protect the environment. Our planners create designs using sound planning and knowledge of local regulations to navigate approvals. Our public participation experts engage stakeholders to build consensus. Landscape architects, commercial specialists, and architects design the facilities that attract and engage the public. <br>
<br>
Our approach to community development forms wildlife habitat, restores wetlands for future generations, and builds neighborhoods where bicyclists ride on trails and families picnic in parks. By creating unique spaces that respond to the land and the people who use them, we&#39;re bringing community to life.<br>

                            As 2,500 environmental staff covering 20 technical specialties, we know what to look for. We know what&#39;s required, and we excel at finding ways to match those requirements with project goals. You could say we know a little something about the environment. <br>
<br>
Our passion for it drives our work. When we&#39;re gathering data to permit a new facility or collaborating on a plan to remediate an old one, we&#39;re helping find the balance between progress and protection. Out in the field, we take time to understand the site. When we know the conditions, we can make recommendations that minimize or eliminate changes for you. Safety is also key: the ongoing commitment we&#39;ve made to safety procedures extends from personal protective equipment to the Green Hand program for training our new field staff. Grounded by safety, quality, and ethics, we come up with solutions that perfectly fit the site.<br>
<br>
Whether it&#39;s preparing a complex permit application, monitoring a site during construction, or designing a decommissioning plan, our team&#39;s got the environment down to a science.<br>

                            Our engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) teams work across the upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas industry. We help you find and extract energy sources. We help you move and store them. And we help you turn them into useful products. We design facilities, project by project that begin to take shape and produce oil and gas. Along the way, we make them more efficient, increasing production and finding ways for you to do more with less. But we know that delivering oil and gas to market is just as important as developing it. Moving and storing oil and gas is one of our specialties. We develop, design, install and maintain oil and gas pipelines, facilities, and terminals and have worked with all types of products. Finally, when oil and gas is ready to be turned into thousands of other everyday items, you can count on our experience with systems to handle virtually any chemical found in a refinery. In us, you&#39;ll find a trusted resource with a unique combination industry expertise and local knowledge to deliver custom design solutions.<br>

We create the connections that get people and goods from here to there—whether by car, bus, train, plane, or their own two feet. Working within the context of the communities we serve, we provide planning, engineering, and infrastructure management services that fit the needs of our clients and improve the overall traveler experience. From major expressway and rural roadway projects to bridge rehabilitations, transit systems, and airport design, our focus is always on providing solutions that respect the local environment.<br>
<br>
And for us, simply engineering the various components of a transportation network doesn&#39;t equal success. We also need to meet the needs of the people traveling every day—because Stantec isn&#39;t just a company; we&#39;re people, with the same goals as everyone else—to get where we&#39;re going, safely and efficiently.<br>

                            Transforming land into a residential or mixed-use community, or a public space with parks and trails, requires a mix of technical skill and creative vision, as well as insight into development. We merge this expertise to create value for our clients and community.<br>
<br>
Our clients rely on us to optimize the potential of their land. Our engineers, surveyors, and transportation experts lay the groundwork for infrastructure so a community can run smoothly. Our environmental scientists restore and protect the environment. Our planners create designs using sound planning and knowledge of local regulations to navigate approvals. Our public participation experts engage stakeholders to build consensus. Landscape architects, commercial specialists, and architects design the facilities that attract and engage the public. <br>
<br>
Our approach to community development forms wildlife habitat, restores wetlands for future generations, and builds neighborhoods where bicyclists ride on trails and families picnic in parks. By creating unique spaces that respond to the land and the people who use them, we&#39;re bringing community to life.<br>

                            As 2,500 environmental staff covering 20 technical specialties, we know what to look for. We know what&#39;s required, and we excel at finding ways to match those requirements with project goals. You could say we know a little something about the environment. <br>
<br>
Our passion for it drives our work. When we&#39;re gathering data to permit a new facility or collaborating on a plan to remediate an old one, we&#39;re helping find the balance between progress and protection. Out in the field, we take time to understand the site. When we know the conditions, we can make recommendations that minimize or eliminate changes for you. Safety is also key: the ongoing commitment we&#39;ve made to safety procedures extends from personal protective equipment to the Green Hand program for training our new field staff. Grounded by safety, quality, and ethics, we come up with solutions that perfectly fit the site.<br>
<br>
Whether it&#39;s preparing a complex permit application, monitoring a site during construction, or designing a decommissioning plan, our team&#39;s got the environment down to a science.<br>

                            Our engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) teams work across the upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas industry. We help you find and extract energy sources. We help you move and store them. And we help you turn them into useful products. We design facilities, project by project that begin to take shape and produce oil and gas. Along the way, we make them more efficient, increasing production and finding ways for you to do more with less. But we know that delivering oil and gas to market is just as important as developing it. Moving and storing oil and gas is one of our specialties. We develop, design, install and maintain oil and gas pipelines, facilities, and terminals and have worked with all types of products. Finally, when oil and gas is ready to be turned into thousands of other everyday items, you can count on our experience with systems to handle virtually any chemical found in a refinery. In us, you&#39;ll find a trusted resource with a unique combination industry expertise and local knowledge to deliver custom design solutions.<br>

                            Projects, when successfully delivered, can strengthen your organization and the communities you serve. However, we all know that projects can be full of surprises—escalating costs, schedule delays, scope creep, or worse. But what if your project could be delivered without surprises?<br>
<br>
Our community of program and project management specialists is passionate about achieving predictable project outcomes for our clients. By taking on projects as if they were our own, our business, technical, and project management experts work with you to strategize, plan, and implement projects that help you achieve your organization&#39;s objectives.<br>
<br>
Our award-winning team has managed thousands of projects across all sectors—buildings like hospitals, airports, and entire university campuses; infrastructure like mass transit and water treatment facilities; energy and resource assignments like mines and wind farms. We know from experience that delivering a complex project without surprises doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be challenges. But our creative approach to planning and controls can head off most problems and provide early warnings on the rest, meaning you can manage with confidence and without crisis.<br>

                            A woman driving down the interstate to the airport where she&#39;ll board a plan to Chicago for a meeting. A teenager riding his bike over a major roadway by way of a multi-use path and pedestrian bridge. A man taking the train to visit his grandchildren. Different people, but with a shared goal: to get from Point A to Point B as quickly and safely as possible.<br>
<br>
We create the connections that get people and goods from here to there—whether by car, bus, train, plane, or their own two feet. Working within the context of the communities we serve, we provide planning, engineering, and infrastructure management services that fit the needs of our clients and improve the overall traveler experience. From major expressway and rural roadway projects to bridge rehabilitations, transit systems, and airport design, our focus is always on providing solutions that respect the local environment.<br>
<br>
And for us, simply engineering the various components of a transportation network doesn&#39;t equal success. We also need to meet the needs of the people traveling every day—because Stantec isn&#39;t just a company; we&#39;re people, with the same goals as everyone else—to get where we&#39;re going, safely and efficiently.<br>
