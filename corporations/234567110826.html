                            We are a professional in-your-home pet and home care service that specializes in giving personal love and attention to pets and home owners. <br>
<br>
S I T T I N G   F O R   D O G S   &amp;   C A T S: Going on vacation? Business trip? Want to catch a sports game or go out to dinner? Then you need a House Call! We can come to your home and feed your pets, refill water, administer medication, exercise and play with your pets, and give them lots of attention.<br>
<br>
S I T T I N G   F O R   O T H E R   P E T S: Can&#39;t take your small animal(s) with you on that trip, vacation, or to work where you spend long hours? Plan on leaving your pet(s) alone for 2 or more hours longer than you normally would? Are you sure something unusual or unexpected won&#39;t happen when you&#39;re away? Then let us help!<br>
<br>
F I T N E S S   F O R   P A W S   (dog walks): Are you unable to give your dog enough exercise? Is your dog overly anxious or excited? Does your dog behave destructively, like chew your shoes? Does your schedule stop you from taking your dog out for regular walks, to eliminate and stretch its legs? Then you need our help! We can come to your home to walk and exercise your dog following a schedule that fits your needs - and those of your dog.<br>
<br>
P U P P Y   P A W S   B R E A K S: Puppies need to eat at least 3 times a day, and to drink lots of water. This puts stress on their under-developed bowels and bladders, which is why they need to be let out more frequently than adult dogs. Pups also need to be socialized early on to help them learn not be afraid of other animals, people or things. If your schedule keeps you too busy, let us help you help your new pup. <br>
<br>
S P E C I A L   P E T   M E D I C A L   C A R E: Checking in or out of a Veterinarian hospital/clinic with your pet when a medical situation is involved can be overwhelming, and ensuring your pet receives accurate and timely post-discharge care that your Veterinarian prescribed can be daunting. If you need support at the Vet hospital/clinic, or if you find that giving medical care to your pet is intimidating, complicated, time consuming, or unnerving, give us a call. Providing you with medical support and giving pets rehabilitative care are services in which we specialize. <br>
<br>
D E N T A L   C A R E: Periodontal disease affects 85% of adult dogs and cats. This can lead to bad breath, tooth loss, and pain. Even worse, chronic oral infection can spread harmful bacteria to other parts of the body, including the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. Fortunately, most periodontal disease is preventable through a program of oral hygiene and regular professional care. If you&#39;ve tried to brush your pet&#39;s teeth but gave up because your pet hated it or because you found it too difficult, let us help you for just a few minutes a day!<br>
<br>
W E L C O M E   H O M E: If you travel and expect to arrive home late in the day or at night, and aren&#39;t likely to have fresh milk, bread, and produce at home, or if you&#39;d like to avoid coming to a home that&#39;s a little stuffy, too hot or too cold, and you&#39;d like someone to make it just right, let us help. We offer a wide range of services designed to welcome you home so you can feel &quot;home&quot; again!<br>
<br>
H O M E   S H U T   D O W N: If you&#39;ve had to leave home in a hurry, or are already away and not coming back as planned, and winter is fast approaching or already here, let us help. This service is specifically offered to help you winterize your home when you can&#39;t!<br>
<br>
H O M E   S I T T I N G   &amp;   S E C U R I T Y   C H E C K S: If youre travelling for business or pleasure  from a weekend getaway to a winter-long stay down south, dont let your home advertise that youre gone for a prolonged time. Part of the joy of travelling is knowing that youll be able to return to a safe, secure, and welcoming home. This is where we can help!<br>
<br>
P L A N T S   &amp;   G A R D E N S: Without water or with too much water, plants will die. Balancing a plant&#39;s water needs - giving it water in moderation - is like giving it a healthy diet. In addition, fertilizers help plants grow and develop fruit and flowers. If you don&#39;t have enough time for your plants/gardens, or plan on being away, then let us help you!<br>

              Mar 2007 &amp;#8213; We are absolutely thrilled with the service we have received from Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting. Sara is fantastic and our minds are completely at ease when we go away. Kitten, our sweet 17 year old tabby, and Link, our 15 year old big boy, need extra attention while we are not at home. Link, in particular, has experienced feline anorexia while we have been away in the past (due to stress) and we almost lost him. With Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting, we have no doubt that he is getting the attention and TLC that he needs.  He looked absolutely fantastic when we came home and the report cards are great.  Kitten, is a shy older soul who loves Sara.  She is kind and gentle &amp;#8213; just the type of person kitten likes! Sara and Amy Shannon will leave us messages and even send us an email to set our minds at ease.  I have no hesitation in recommending Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting in the future. I know our kids are happy and safe when Sara looks after them!<br>

November 2006 &amp;#8213; Poppie George is an adorable dwarf bunny who will be celebrating his 11th birthday in May 2007. He is very special to us and has traveled with us everywhere!  Unfortunately, due to his age, we didn&#39;t want to put him through a trip over the border ... knowing that he&#39;d have a hard time of it (we were flying and he was considered &quot;livestock&quot; so we would not be able to have him with us on board).  I found Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting on the Internet - we are relatively new to Ottawa and had no one to &quot;bunny-sit&quot;.  Amy Shannon and I spoke on the telephone and she was lovely.  She said that she would put me in touch with Clare for a &quot;Meet and Greet&quot;. When Clare arrived, we were so relieved to see what a sweet person she is as we couldn&#39;t leave our &quot;fur-baby&quot; with just anyone! Poppie took a shine to her right away, which doesn&#39;t happen very often. He loves us but is wary of strangers. We went away knowing we didn&#39;t have to worry with Clare there.  <br>
<br>
Our trip back was a nightmare with late planes and missing luggage. We were suppose to be back early afternoon and were just trundling home at 9:30 p.m. when we saw Clare drive up!  Bless her!  She had called the house and when she couldn&#39;t get hold of us she thought she&#39;d better come over and give Poppie his bed-snack :)  When we got upstairs, she had everything so nice for us. She had kept a record of her time with Poppie who behaved himself, which we were happy to hear. It was a cute read :) Our mail was on the table. Everything was neat and tidy. All I can say it that I can&#39;t say enough about Clare, Amy Shannon and Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting. Thanks so much! Bunny nudges from Poppie!<br>

Oct 2006 &amp;#8213; I would like to say that your service was a godsend.  I was initially very hesitant in obtaining a pet Sitter as I heard all kinds of horror stories from people who had hired other pet sitting services. But your service was amazing! The cats were well taken care of, they were well fed and very relaxed when I returned - and your &#39;report card&#39; on their behaviour was great! I will certainly use your services again and I have no hesitation in recommending your services to other pet owners! <br>
<br>
September 2006 &amp;#8213; We would like to thank you for taking such good care of our dogs every time we entrust them with you.  We have used your service now on a couple of occasions and have been very happy with it.  Prior to using Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting we would leave Ashley and Zoe in a registered kennel for the length of our absence.  Upon our return wed notice the dogs would be very tired for the next couple of days and also a little distant.  They were taken away from their familiar surroundings and placed in a cage as opposed to having the run of the house.  There would always be a lot of noise at the kennel and due to this the girls would be tired and anxious when they got home.  Their eating habits would also be disrupted as a result.  <br>
<br>
Ashley requires a little extra care in that she tends to be very aggressive; because of this, they have to be taken out together but without other dogs around.<br>
<br>
Since weve used your services, nothing is different in our dogs behaviour.  When we return home after an absence, we find that they are as content as always.  They are sleeping on their favourite pillows in the living room, theres music in the background, and everything we ask from your service is done very well.  <br>
<br>
To our amazement, the first time we used your services we returned to find a diary on the counter indicating everything that occurred in our absence.  Its very comforting to know that, while we do not like to leave our dogs, we have the piece of mind of knowing that our girls are in the best possible care.  We would, and already have, recommend this service to friends who share our concerns.<br>

                            We are a professional in-your-home pet and home care service that specializes in giving personal love and attention to pets and home owners. <br>
<br>
S I T T I N G   F O R   D O G S   &amp;   C A T S: Going on vacation? Business trip? Want to catch a sports game or go out to dinner? Then you need a House Call! We can come to your home and feed your pets, refill water, administer medication, exercise and play with your pets, and give them lots of attention.<br>
<br>
S I T T I N G   F O R   O T H E R   P E T S: Can&#39;t take your small animal(s) with you on that trip, vacation, or to work where you spend long hours? Plan on leaving your pet(s) alone for 2 or more hours longer than you normally would? Are you sure something unusual or unexpected won&#39;t happen when you&#39;re away? Then let us help!<br>
<br>
F I T N E S S   F O R   P A W S   (dog walks): Are you unable to give your dog enough exercise? Is your dog overly anxious or excited? Does your dog behave destructively, like chew your shoes? Does your schedule stop you from taking your dog out for regular walks, to eliminate and stretch its legs? Then you need our help! We can come to your home to walk and exercise your dog following a schedule that fits your needs - and those of your dog.<br>
<br>
P U P P Y   P A W S   B R E A K S: Puppies need to eat at least 3 times a day, and to drink lots of water. This puts stress on their under-developed bowels and bladders, which is why they need to be let out more frequently than adult dogs. Pups also need to be socialized early on to help them learn not be afraid of other animals, people or things. If your schedule keeps you too busy, let us help you help your new pup. <br>
<br>
S P E C I A L   P E T   M E D I C A L   C A R E: Checking in or out of a Veterinarian hospital/clinic with your pet when a medical situation is involved can be overwhelming, and ensuring your pet receives accurate and timely post-discharge care that your Veterinarian prescribed can be daunting. If you need support at the Vet hospital/clinic, or if you find that giving medical care to your pet is intimidating, complicated, time consuming, or unnerving, give us a call. Providing you with medical support and giving pets rehabilitative care are services in which we specialize. <br>
<br>
D E N T A L   C A R E: Periodontal disease affects 85% of adult dogs and cats. This can lead to bad breath, tooth loss, and pain. Even worse, chronic oral infection can spread harmful bacteria to other parts of the body, including the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. Fortunately, most periodontal disease is preventable through a program of oral hygiene and regular professional care. If you&#39;ve tried to brush your pet&#39;s teeth but gave up because your pet hated it or because you found it too difficult, let us help you for just a few minutes a day!<br>
<br>
W E L C O M E   H O M E: If you travel and expect to arrive home late in the day or at night, and aren&#39;t likely to have fresh milk, bread, and produce at home, or if you&#39;d like to avoid coming to a home that&#39;s a little stuffy, too hot or too cold, and you&#39;d like someone to make it just right, let us help. We offer a wide range of services designed to welcome you home so you can feel &quot;home&quot; again!<br>
<br>
H O M E   S H U T   D O W N: If you&#39;ve had to leave home in a hurry, or are already away and not coming back as planned, and winter is fast approaching or already here, let us help. This service is specifically offered to help you winterize your home when you can&#39;t!<br>
<br>
H O M E   S I T T I N G   &amp;   S E C U R I T Y   C H E C K S: If youre travelling for business or pleasure  from a weekend getaway to a winter-long stay down south, dont let your home advertise that youre gone for a prolonged time. Part of the joy of travelling is knowing that youll be able to return to a safe, secure, and welcoming home. This is where we can help!<br>
<br>
P L A N T S   &amp;   G A R D E N S: Without water or with too much water, plants will die. Balancing a plant&#39;s water needs - giving it water in moderation - is like giving it a healthy diet. In addition, fertilizers help plants grow and develop fruit and flowers. If you don&#39;t have enough time for your plants/gardens, or plan on being away, then let us help you!<br>

              Mar 2007 &amp;#8213; We are absolutely thrilled with the service we have received from Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting. Sara is fantastic and our minds are completely at ease when we go away. Kitten, our sweet 17 year old tabby, and Link, our 15 year old big boy, need extra attention while we are not at home. Link, in particular, has experienced feline anorexia while we have been away in the past (due to stress) and we almost lost him. With Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting, we have no doubt that he is getting the attention and TLC that he needs.  He looked absolutely fantastic when we came home and the report cards are great.  Kitten, is a shy older soul who loves Sara.  She is kind and gentle &amp;#8213; just the type of person kitten likes! Sara and Amy Shannon will leave us messages and even send us an email to set our minds at ease.  I have no hesitation in recommending Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting in the future. I know our kids are happy and safe when Sara looks after them!<br>
<br>
November 2006 &amp;#8213; Poppie George is an adorable dwarf bunny who will be celebrating his 11th birthday in May 2007. He is very special to us and has traveled with us everywhere!  Unfortunately, due to his age, we didn&#39;t want to put him through a trip over the border ... knowing that he&#39;d have a hard time of it (we were flying and he was considered &quot;livestock&quot; so we would not be able to have him with us on board).  I found Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting on the Internet - we are relatively new to Ottawa and had no one to &quot;bunny-sit&quot;.  Amy Shannon and I spoke on the telephone and she was lovely.  She said that she would put me in touch with Clare for a &quot;Meet and Greet&quot;. When Clare arrived, we were so relieved to see what a sweet person she is as we couldn&#39;t leave our &quot;fur-baby&quot; with just anyone! Poppie took a shine to her right away, which doesn&#39;t happen very often. He loves us but is wary of strangers. We went away knowing we didn&#39;t have to worry with Clare there.  <br>
<br>
Our trip back was a nightmare with late planes and missing luggage. We were suppose to be back early afternoon and were just trundling home at 9:30 p.m. when we saw Clare drive up!  Bless her!  She had called the house and when she couldn&#39;t get hold of us she thought she&#39;d better come over and give Poppie his bed-snack :)  When we got upstairs, she had everything so nice for us. She had kept a record of her time with Poppie who behaved himself, which we were happy to hear. It was a cute read :) Our mail was on the table. Everything was neat and tidy. All I can say it that I can&#39;t say enough about Clare, Amy Shannon and Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting. Thanks so much! Bunny nudges from Poppie!<br>

Oct 2006 &amp;#8213; I would like to say that your service was a godsend.  I was initially very hesitant in obtaining a pet Sitter as I heard all kinds of horror stories from people who had hired other pet sitting services. But your service was amazing! The cats were well taken care of, they were well fed and very relaxed when I returned - and your &#39;report card&#39; on their behaviour was great! I will certainly use your services again and I have no hesitation in recommending your services to other pet owners! <br>
<br>
September 2006 &amp;#8213; We would like to thank you for taking such good care of our dogs every time we entrust them with you.  We have used your service now on a couple of occasions and have been very happy with it.  Prior to using Loving Paws &amp; House Sitting we would leave Ashley and Zoe in a registered kennel for the length of our absence.  Upon our return wed notice the dogs would be very tired for the next couple of days and also a little distant.  They were taken away from their familiar surroundings and placed in a cage as opposed to having the run of the house.  There would always be a lot of noise at the kennel and due to this the girls would be tired and anxious when they got home.  Their eating habits would also be disrupted as a result.  <br>
<br>
Ashley requires a little extra care in that she tends to be very aggressive; because of this, they have to be taken out together but without other dogs around.<br>
<br>
Since weve used your services, nothing is different in our dogs behaviour.  When we return home after an absence, we find that they are as content as always.  They are sleeping on their favourite pillows in the living room, theres music in the background, and everything we ask from your service is done very well.  <br>
<br>
To our amazement, the first time we used your services we returned to find a diary on the counter indicating everything that occurred in our absence.  Its very comforting to know that, while we do not like to leave our dogs, we have the piece of mind of knowing that our girls are in the best possible care.  We would, and already have, recommend this service to friends who share our concerns.<br>
