                            When Wardrop started to undertake international work, we were immediately reminded of the fundamental social and environmental implications of development. Our projects started primarily in the field of water resource development (mostly groundwater supply). Through the installation of many thousands of water supply wells in rural communities, we quickly learned that the implications were far beyond water supply  and we commenced with the provision of many support services around community health and sanitation, and transportation. <br>
<br>
Wardrop understands the countries and communities we work in and the obstacles that prevent meaningful change.  We strive to develop mutually beneficial, ongoing relationships with our clients and local partners, and bring forward a personal commitment to alleviating poverty. <br>
<br>
We can bring the latest technology to a project and adapt it to clients needs, to produce sustainable development outcomes. The most recent project is the Ghana Sustainability Project, which was initiated in the late 1990s and completed in 2008. Forty years of successful projects paired with dedication to helping our clients reach their goals cannot be duplicated by any other organization. <br>
<br>
Wardrop has managed many projects with capital budgets in the tens of millions of dollars for clients such as the World Bank, other multilateral development banks and several bilateral aid agencies such as the Canadian International Development Agency.  We have worked for public sector organizations such as national, state and local governments and for the private sector  global and local, large and small  around the world.<br>

                            Environmental Assessments and/or Licensing are an often necessary element of our clients project development and approvals process.  At Wardrop, we are often requested to provide these services as a supporting feature to our engineering design teams.  <br>
<br>
Properly conducted environmental assessments:<br>
- Protect the environment <br>
- Identify mitigation measures <br>
- Defines follow-up requirements <br>
- Prevent cost overruns <br>
- Avoid time delays <br>
- Promote government trust <br>
- Gain public confidence <br>
- Prevent surprise events <br>
 <br>
Our environmental staff members have prepared numerous EAs and comprehensive studies under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA), participated in several public panel reviews, provided basic training for the CEAA and taught EA classes at universities and colleges.<br>
<br>
REGULATORY RELATIONSHIPS:<br>
<br>
Government environmental legislation is constantly being amended and is becoming very complex and onerous. Responsibilities for environmental issues are being harmonized and shifted to different jurisdictions. Penalties for environmental infractions have increased and the laws are applied stringently. It is not enough to be aware, one must be on top of what seems to be ever changing environmental legislation at all government levels.<br>
<br>
Throughout the years, our staff members have established trusted relationships with various jurisdictional regulators. These relationships, paired with early engagement, smooth the way for more efficient management of the regulatory approval process, which reduces the project costs and allows the project schedule to be maintained.<br>

                            Phase I and II Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) can be requested as part of property transfer or development; normal corporate due diligence; site decommissioning and closure; or spill/leak response and abatement.<br>
<br>
In many instances, our project team has carried out environmental projects through the entire assessment process starting with identifying potential environmental concerns utilizing a Phase I ESA, Historical Records Review or Baseline Study followed by intrusive investigation of the identified areas of concern. Depending on the project, intrusive investigation has included shallow vapour surveys, geophysical surveys and Phase II ESAs such as: test pit assessments; borehole investigations; surface water, sediment sampling programs; monitoring and groundwater sampling programs.<br>

                            Prior to commencing a remediation program, Wardrop performs a site assessment and contaminant characterization in order to understand the complexities of the problem that will enable the development of potential remedial strategies. Once the site assessment and contaminant characterization are completed, a site-specific remedial program can be developed and implemented using innovative and proven remedial strategies. Program support continues through modelling and analysis to assess environmental risks, contaminant fate and transport. Longer-term risk is managed using techniques such as monitored natural attenuation.<br>

                            Brownfields are former industrial or commercial developments that no longer operate and stand empty. Many are contaminated (leaking underground fuel storage tanks, on-site disposal of waste materials or dumping of process by-products) and many are abandoned. This creates liability uncertainty, which devalues the property and increases the risk for potential investors. Wardrop has the technical resources to complete a thorough assessment of the property, identify and evaluate the risks, and develop and manage a comprehensive remediation plan to bring the land up to standards suitable for reuse.<br>
<br>
Typical services performed by Wardrop in this regard include:<br>
- Identification and delineation of contaminated areas <br>
- Identification of human and environmental health risks around these areas <br>
- Development of risk mitigation strategies, including cost estimating <br>
- Liaison with regulatory authorities <br>
- Long-term environmental monitoring <br>

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              James A. Richardson International Airport (YWG)<br>
<br>
The James A. Richardson International Airport (YWG) in Winnipeg, Manitoba embarked on a $585 M Airport Site Redevelopment (ASR) program in 2004. The project balances the Winnipeg Airport Authoritys (WAA) vision of leading transportation innovation, while reflecting its prairie roots and heritage.  The complex ASR project entails 51,000 m² signature terminal building, new, four-level car parking garage and elevated roadway, aircraft apron expansion, drainage, and power house upgrades. To advocate on their behalf, the WAA engaged Wardrop Engineering Inc. to act as the Owners Engineer. Acting as the owners advocate, Wardrop manages those contracts fairly and legally. Beyond contract management, the owners engineer coordinates between the owner, designers and contractors so that everyone understands each other and maintains a balance of design integrity, cost savings and construction schedule. With the onset of construction, Wardrop also monitored the Contractors Quality Control program. <br>
<br>
Expansion and Upgrades at City of Thunder Bays Water Pollution Control Plant<br>
<br>
The Great Lakes is the largest fresh water resource in the world. Maintaining the integrity of Lake Superior, the most northern of the great lakes, is a priority for the City of Thunder Bay. The Citys commitment was first demonstrated through the development of a Pollution Prevention and Control Plant in 1964 which was designed by Wardrop. This commitment was further enacted through the expansion and addition of secondary treatment at the Citys Atlantic Avenue Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). Wardrop partnered with Reid Crowther to design and construct this $75M major expansion and retrofit of the existing Atlantic Avenue Water Pollution Control Plant, creating a new state-of-the-art 265 ML/day Secondary Sewage Treatment Plant. The design was initiated in January 2000, and the project was commissioned fall 2005. Wardrop was responsible for the detailed design of the civil, structural, utility mechanical, and electrical.  <br>
<br>
Pickering B NGS Condition Assessment<br>
<br>
The Pickering Nuclear Generating Station (NGS) consists of eight CANDU nuclear reactors and is divided into Pickering A (4 units) and Pickering B (4 units). The first Pickering B unit went in-service on May 10, 1983 and the last unit went in-service on February 28, 1986. The original design life for these units is 40 years.  OPG (owner/operator) initiated a Refurbishment Study to determine the feasibility of extending Pickering B operational life to 2050-2060.  Wardrop performed a Condition Assessment of the Pickering B NGS systems, structures, and components (SSCs), as well as outbuildings (70), as part of the Plant Life Extension Project. Wardrop performed more than 350 individual component* condition assessments and finalized 65 System Condition Assessment (SCA) reports that summarized the ageing management evaluation for each system and its components. Specific recommendations addressed requirements to achieve safe and reliable operation for the stations planned end-of-life, as well as additional recommendations for life extension. <br>
<br>
Toronto Hydro<br>
<br>
Wardrop is working with two contractors for several design/build projects for Toronto Hydrothe second largest municipal utility in North America. Together, the team fulfills all aspects of the multiyear, capital works, rehabilitation program (valued at $100 million annually), including design, permitting and construction. Works will enhance reliability, improve service, reduce power outages, facilitate future growth and enhance safety. Sample projects include overhead wiring and underground cabling, utility relocation and Hand Well Replacement Program (1600). <br>
<br>
Hydro One<br>
<br>
Wardrop has worked closely with Hydro One since 2004 and delivers a variety of services through a Master Services Agreement, which was renewed in 2007 and 2010.  Work has included detailed design for revenue metering upgrades, design of special protection schemes, asset management planning for sustainment programs, design of special protection schemes, preparation of quality assurance manuals, operational training and mentoring, various planning studies, RTU (Remote Terminal Units) and breaker replacements, and analysis of protection and telecom operation across the province.

                            Todays electricity marketplace is changing rapidlydemand is growing, consumers are more educated and expectations of higher service levels have become the norm. Utilities, operators, government agencies and other transmission &amp; distribution (T&amp;D) asset owners struggle to balance finite budgets, deliver sustainable infrastructure under aggressive project schedules, and meet changing regulatory requirements.<br>
<br>
Wardrops transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) specialists provide all of the services needed to conduct economic and technical evaluations, prepare feasibility studies, specify and procure all major engineered equipment, design and supervise the construction of grid interconnections, substations, and T&amp;D lines for utilities and industrial users.

STATIONS<br>
Dependence on the grid system demands quality and performance from both the infrastructure and the people who provide design and maintenance services. Wardrops staff members have an extensive utility background, which provides a solid foundation for the services we offer: planning, studies, site configuration, permits, design, procurement, construction, commissioning and training.<br>
<br>
Our intimate knowledge of the industry and understanding of the different challenges faced by the local distribution companies, industrial clients and energy developers permits us to develop solutions that meet their operational goals, whether it is a RTU replacement program, the development of a customized control system or connecting to the grid.<br>
<br>
Our experience includes substations, up to 500 kV AC, in various bus and switchgear configurations, and we provide a full suite of services to support design, construction and operation of these stations including: facility electrical protection and control, system telecommunication networks, substation and distribution automation, and development and coordination of complete maintenance programs. Working side-by-side with our clients, we develop solutions that increase productivity and profitability<br>
 <br>
LINES<br>
Dotting the landscape, connecting cities and towns, transmission lines are the lifeline to every home and business. They transcend the crowded urban landscape, cross through the most challenging of geographic environments, and endure the most severe weather conditions. Spanning hundreds of kilometers, transmission lines need to be designed with forethought to future demand, the environment and risk in order to provide years of delivery and ease of maintenance.<br>
<br>
To help our clients anticipate and meet these challenges, Wardrop provides analytical studies, design, and project and construction management services for transmission and distribution. We have completed projects such as overhead power transmission to 230 kV AC and HVDC studies. We are also well versed in the various structural designs for foundations, towers, etc. using several media (steel, concrete and wood) so our solutions are truly tailored to the needs of the client, the environment within they are working in, budget constraints and long-term goals for the project.<br>
<br>
TECHNICAL CONSULTING &amp; SERVICES<br>
We have cultivated a team of staff members that has unparalleled comprehension from generation through to the whole distribution and delivery system. It is because of this expertise, that Wardrop can develop a specific team to assist our clients to identify and capitalize on opportunities to improve service delivery and safety, minimize risk and increase reliability.<br>
<br>
We have extensive experience in:<br>
- Load Flow analysis, relay protection, and short circuit studies <br>
- System telecommunication networks EMS (energy management systems) and DMS (distribution <br>

                            When Wardrop started to undertake international work, we were immediately reminded of the fundamental social and environmental implications of development. Our projects started primarily in the field of water resource development (mostly groundwater supply). Through the installation of many thousands of water supply wells in rural communities, we quickly learned that the implications were far beyond water supply  and we commenced with the provision of many support services around community health and sanitation, and transportation. <br>
<br>
Wardrop understands the countries and communities we work in and the obstacles that prevent meaningful change.  We strive to develop mutually beneficial, ongoing relationships with our clients and local partners, and bring forward a personal commitment to alleviating poverty. <br>
<br>
We can bring the latest technology to a project and adapt it to clients needs, to produce sustainable development outcomes. The most recent project is the Ghana Sustainability Project, which was initiated in the late 1990s and completed in 2008. Forty years of successful projects paired with dedication to helping our clients reach their goals cannot be duplicated by any other organization. <br>
<br>
Wardrop has managed many projects with capital budgets in the tens of millions of dollars for clients such as the World Bank, other multilateral development banks and several bilateral aid agencies such as the Canadian International Development Agency.  We have worked for public sector organizations such as national, state and local governments and for the private sector  global and local, large and small  around the world.<br>

                            Environmental Assessments and/or Licensing are an often necessary element of our clients project development and approvals process.  At Wardrop, we are often requested to provide these services as a supporting feature to our engineering design teams.  <br>
<br>
Properly conducted environmental assessments:<br>
- Protect the environment <br>
- Identify mitigation measures <br>
- Defines follow-up requirements <br>
- Prevent cost overruns <br>
- Avoid time delays <br>
- Promote government trust <br>
- Gain public confidence <br>
- Prevent surprise events <br>
 <br>
Our environmental staff members have prepared numerous EAs and comprehensive studies under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA), participated in several public panel reviews, provided basic training for the CEAA and taught EA classes at universities and colleges.<br>
<br>
REGULATORY RELATIONSHIPS:<br>
<br>
Government environmental legislation is constantly being amended and is becoming very complex and onerous. Responsibilities for environmental issues are being harmonized and shifted to different jurisdictions. Penalties for environmental infractions have increased and the laws are applied stringently. It is not enough to be aware, one must be on top of what seems to be ever changing environmental legislation at all government levels.<br>
<br>
Throughout the years, our staff members have established trusted relationships with various jurisdictional regulators. These relationships, paired with early engagement, smooth the way for more efficient management of the regulatory approval process, which reduces the project costs and allows the project schedule to be maintained.<br>

                            Phase I and II Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) can be requested as part of property transfer or development; normal corporate due diligence; site decommissioning and closure; or spill/leak response and abatement.<br>
<br>
In many instances, our project team has carried out environmental projects through the entire assessment process starting with identifying potential environmental concerns utilizing a Phase I ESA, Historical Records Review or Baseline Study followed by intrusive investigation of the identified areas of concern. Depending on the project, intrusive investigation has included shallow vapour surveys, geophysical surveys and Phase II ESAs such as: test pit assessments; borehole investigations; surface water, sediment sampling programs; monitoring and groundwater sampling programs.<br>

                            Prior to commencing a remediation program, Wardrop performs a site assessment and contaminant characterization in order to understand the complexities of the problem that will enable the development of potential remedial strategies. Once the site assessment and contaminant characterization are completed, a site-specific remedial program can be developed and implemented using innovative and proven remedial strategies. Program support continues through modelling and analysis to assess environmental risks, contaminant fate and transport. Longer-term risk is managed using techniques such as monitored natural attenuation.<br>

                            Brownfields are former industrial or commercial developments that no longer operate and stand empty. Many are contaminated (leaking underground fuel storage tanks, on-site disposal of waste materials or dumping of process by-products) and many are abandoned. This creates liability uncertainty, which devalues the property and increases the risk for potential investors. Wardrop has the technical resources to complete a thorough assessment of the property, identify and evaluate the risks, and develop and manage a comprehensive remediation plan to bring the land up to standards suitable for reuse.<br>
<br>
Typical services performed by Wardrop in this regard include:<br>
- Identification and delineation of contaminated areas <br>
- Identification of human and environmental health risks around these areas <br>
- Development of risk mitigation strategies, including cost estimating <br>
- Liaison with regulatory authorities <br>
- Long-term environmental monitoring <br>

                            Demolition waste from construction can be as benign as bricks, concrete and wood where much of it can be recycled. There are also aspects that pose environmental hazards if demolition is not properly conducted, including lead, asbestos and other hazardous substances.<br>
<br>
To ensure the protection and safety of the workers and the environment, Wardrop provides environmental inspection services during industrial demolition projects, including pre-demolition inspection and sampling, waste stream sampling, identification of receiving facilities, and post-demolition inspections. Our assignments have included services during the demolition/removal of commercial buildings, fuel storage facilities, and natural gas pipelines, compressor stations and associated facilities.<br>

              </h4>
           
              James A. Richardson International Airport (YWG)<br>
<br>
The James A. Richardson International Airport (YWG) in Winnipeg, Manitoba embarked on a $585 M Airport Site Redevelopment (ASR) program in 2004. The project balances the Winnipeg Airport Authoritys (WAA) vision of leading transportation innovation, while reflecting its prairie roots and heritage.  The complex ASR project entails 51,000 m² signature terminal building, new, four-level car parking garage and elevated roadway, aircraft apron expansion, drainage, and power house upgrades. To advocate on their behalf, the WAA engaged Wardrop Engineering Inc. to act as the Owners Engineer. Acting as the owners advocate, Wardrop manages those contracts fairly and legally. Beyond contract management, the owners engineer coordinates between the owner, designers and contractors so that everyone understands each other and maintains a balance of design integrity, cost savings and construction schedule. With the onset of construction, Wardrop also monitored the Contractors Quality Control program. <br>
<br>
Expansion and Upgrades at City of Thunder Bays Water Pollution Control Plant<br>
<br>
The Great Lakes is the largest fresh water resource in the world. Maintaining the integrity of Lake Superior, the most northern of the great lakes, is a priority for the City of Thunder Bay. The Citys commitment was first demonstrated through the development of a Pollution Prevention and Control Plant in 1964 which was designed by Wardrop. This commitment was further enacted through the expansion and addition of secondary treatment at the Citys Atlantic Avenue Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). Wardrop partnered with Reid Crowther to design and construct this $75M major expansion and retrofit of the existing Atlantic Avenue Water Pollution Control Plant, creating a new state-of-the-art 265 ML/day Secondary Sewage Treatment Plant. The design was initiated in January 2000, and the project was commissioned fall 2005. Wardrop was responsible for the detailed design of the civil, structural, utility mechanical, and electrical.  <br>
<br>
Pickering B NGS Condition Assessment<br>
<br>
The Pickering Nuclear Generating Station (NGS) consists of eight CANDU nuclear reactors and is divided into Pickering A (4 units) and Pickering B (4 units). The first Pickering B unit went in-service on May 10, 1983 and the last unit went in-service on February 28, 1986. The original design life for these units is 40 years.  OPG (owner/operator) initiated a Refurbishment Study to determine the feasibility of extending Pickering B operational life to 2050-2060.  Wardrop performed a Condition Assessment of the Pickering B NGS systems, structures, and components (SSCs), as well as outbuildings (70), as part of the Plant Life Extension Project. Wardrop performed more than 350 individual component* condition assessments and finalized 65 System Condition Assessment (SCA) reports that summarized the ageing management evaluation for each system and its components. Specific recommendations addressed requirements to achieve safe and reliable operation for the stations planned end-of-life, as well as additional recommendations for life extension. <br>
<br>
Toronto Hydro<br>
<br>
Wardrop is working with two contractors for several design/build projects for Toronto Hydrothe second largest municipal utility in North America. Together, the team fulfills all aspects of the multiyear, capital works, rehabilitation program (valued at $100 million annually), including design, permitting and construction. Works will enhance reliability, improve service, reduce power outages, facilitate future growth and enhance safety. Sample projects include overhead wiring and underground cabling, utility relocation and Hand Well Replacement Program (1600). <br>
<br>
Hydro One<br>
<br>
Wardrop has worked closely with Hydro One since 2004 and delivers a variety of services through a Master Services Agreement, which was renewed in 2007 and 2010.  Work has included detailed design for revenue metering upgrades, design of special protection schemes, asset management planning for sustainment programs, design of special protection schemes, preparation of quality assurance manuals, operational training and mentoring, various planning studies, RTU (Remote Terminal Units) and breaker replacements, and analysis of protection and telecom operation across the province.
