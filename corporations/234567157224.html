                            Our UX Design methods focus on how to deliver exceptional screen-based experiences that truly work for people.<br>
We demystify UX design by following a strong yet flexible process, using a set of deliverables that help us articulate different aspects of the design in concrete ways. We organize, conceptualize and prototype design approaches, refining and enhancing our work until we’ve found the right mix of practicality and ease of use.<br>
But design is more than process – it requires imagination and inspiration as well. While our process and analytical approach helps smooth the way, it is the creativity we bring to the table that makes the final product truly memorable.<br>

                            Strategy is about more than planning. It is a revealing process where current knowledge and expectations of your business are validated, and the things you don’t know are uncovered and analyzed.<br>
<br>
The more you know about your own business, the harder it is to see it from an outside perspective. While your own objectives must be met, the end users’ needs are of equal importance. Strategic decisions have to include the users’ perspective.<br>
<br>
The market landscape is also critical. Your products need to fill a need that is unmet, or met poorly.<br>
<br>
This is our approach to strategy: finding the insights that lie at the intersection of business requirements, user needs, and market demand.<br>

                            Service Design uses a variety of design tools to streamline the way your business works, making it more efficient, useful and enjoyable as a whole, for both your end users and your business stakeholders.<br>
<br>
While UX design tends to be product-focussed, service design reaches more broadly across channels, business units, stakeholders, digital properties and products, to provide a more holistic view of your services overall.<br>
<br>
Our Service Design tools help clients get a big-picture understanding of their business, identifying pain points and providing opportunities to improve and evolve the service offering.<br>

                            People are wonderfully unpredictable. What they say and how they act can be quite different, depending on context. Research can help you understand expectations and behaviour in the context of your project.<br>
<br>
Our research is custom tailored to your needs – choosing the right method to get you the answers you need. Typically, early in the process when user needs and expectations are key, we use design-focussed consultation methods. Further into the project, we lean more heavily on observational methods that investigate actual user behaviour – what people do, rather than what they think.<br>
<br>
Our research methods are incorporated throughout the project at key points – choosing strategic moments to consult users and iterate our design approaches.<br>

The challenge was to develop a navigation system that would make all of our rich content easily accessible and we were amazed at how quickly and efficiently the Usability Matters team was able to accomplish this task. In addition, the well laid-out wireframes made the creation of the site templates an easy task for our designers. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Usability Matters to anyone planning a complete overhaul of a content-rich website. They do amazing work!”<br>

“As a small charity, we pride ourselves on compassionate and personalized client service. UM worked closely with us to understand the goals and operation of our organization. They were respectful of our constraints and were adept and responsive to input from all levels. From their overview of our current process, we were able to identify areas for improvement in communication and administration. UM helped us advance our overall goal of making services client-friendly, and developed real, concrete changes that could help us improve right away.” <br>

“I’ve had the pleasure of working with Usability Matters over the course of a lengthy engagement, which included intensive wireframe design work and thorough usability testing on a complex e-commerce website. Usability Matters’ specifications were clear and easy to follow, and most importantly, every interaction was carefully and thoroughly thought out. My team was able to work closely with several individuals from UM, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this firm to anyone looking for a focused, intelligent approach to user experience.&quot;<br>

“I’ve worked on several formal and informal usability evaluation projects with Usability Matters. In addition to efficiently run projects that were always on time and on budget, our team was impressed by the insight that went into the recommendations for resolving issues. Usability Matters consistently outperforms the many usability labs we’ve worked with worldwide. This and that they are just so easy to work with, is why we keep coming back to Usability Matters.”<br>

“We’ve been fans of the Usability Matters team for years.

“I’ve worked with Usability Matters now on three significant projects, each of which has had different objectives, and I’ve been very impressed in each case. They listened carefully to our needs, provided a cogent analysis of appropriate study methodologies, followed through perfectly on a myriad of details and provided excellent written reports of results and debriefing sessions. These projects helped us articulate the questions we wanted to answer, and the results helped immensely to inform the development of our online user environments.&quot;<br>

“We have been working with the team at Usability Matters for over 4 years now. There are many reasons why they are often amongst the first that come to mind for user experience and strategy projects. They truly care about the end product as much as we do and that shows in all their deliverables. We attribute their success to their collaborative approach that serves as the cherry on top of their core competency in user experience science and design. This is a team that I personally won’t hesitate to recommend because I know they will deliver on their promise.”<br>

&quot;My web development client was one of the world&#39;s largest marketers and thought they knew everything about their website and their customers. <br>
Usability Matters brought new and invaluable information to them and to the process that couldn&#39;t be obtained by doing the same thing ourselves.&quot;<br>
Neil Mohan<br>

<br>
&quot;The reports that Usability Matters produced were nothing short of amazing. Their report format was very easy to read and understand. In virtually all screen-level critiques, they provided a solid wireframe that we could work towards in our development. Most importantly, their report was actionable to the point where we were able to sit with our developer and quickly put together an action plan and new screens. This allowed us to turn-around a new CD-ROM in less than 2 weeks.&quot;<br>

                            Our UX Design methods focus on how to deliver exceptional screen-based experiences that truly work for people.<br>
We demystify UX design by following a strong yet flexible process, using a set of deliverables that help us articulate different aspects of the design in concrete ways. We organize, conceptualize and prototype design approaches, refining and enhancing our work until we’ve found the right mix of practicality and ease of use.<br>
But design is more than process – it requires imagination and inspiration as well. While our process and analytical approach helps smooth the way, it is the creativity we bring to the table that makes the final product truly memorable.<br>

                            Strategy is about more than planning. It is a revealing process where current knowledge and expectations of your business are validated, and the things you don’t know are uncovered and analyzed.<br>
<br>
The more you know about your own business, the harder it is to see it from an outside perspective. While your own objectives must be met, the end users’ needs are of equal importance. Strategic decisions have to include the users’ perspective.<br>
<br>
The market landscape is also critical. Your products need to fill a need that is unmet, or met poorly.<br>
<br>
This is our approach to strategy: finding the insights that lie at the intersection of business requirements, user needs, and market demand.<br>

                            Service Design uses a variety of design tools to streamline the way your business works, making it more efficient, useful and enjoyable as a whole, for both your end users and your business stakeholders.<br>
<br>
While UX design tends to be product-focussed, service design reaches more broadly across channels, business units, stakeholders, digital properties and products, to provide a more holistic view of your services overall.<br>
<br>
Our Service Design tools help clients get a big-picture understanding of their business, identifying pain points and providing opportunities to improve and evolve the service offering.<br>

                            People are wonderfully unpredictable. What they say and how they act can be quite different, depending on context. Research can help you understand expectations and behaviour in the context of your project.<br>
<br>
Our research is custom tailored to your needs – choosing the right method to get you the answers you need. Typically, early in the process when user needs and expectations are key, we use design-focussed consultation methods. Further into the project, we lean more heavily on observational methods that investigate actual user behaviour – what people do, rather than what they think.<br>
<br>
Our research methods are incorporated throughout the project at key points – choosing strategic moments to consult users and iterate our design approaches.<br>

              “We knew we needed a top-notch information architecture firm when we tackled redesigning our 6,000 page, ten year old website. The challenge was to develop a navigation system that would make all of our rich content easily accessible and we were amazed at how quickly and efficiently the Usability Matters team was able to accomplish this task. In addition, the well laid-out wireframes made the creation of the site templates an easy task for our designers. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Usability Matters to anyone planning a complete overhaul of a content-rich website. They do amazing work!”<br>

“As a small charity, we pride ourselves on compassionate and personalized client service. UM worked closely with us to understand the goals and operation of our organization. They were respectful of our constraints and were adept and responsive to input from all levels. From their overview of our current process, we were able to identify areas for improvement in communication and administration. UM helped us advance our overall goal of making services client-friendly, and developed real, concrete changes that could help us improve right away.” <br>

“I’ve had the pleasure of working with Usability Matters over the course of a lengthy engagement, which included intensive wireframe design work and thorough usability testing on a complex e-commerce website. Usability Matters’ specifications were clear and easy to follow, and most importantly, every interaction was carefully and thoroughly thought out. My team was able to work closely with several individuals from UM, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this firm to anyone looking for a focused, intelligent approach to user experience.&quot;<br>

“I’ve worked on several formal and informal usability evaluation projects with Usability Matters. In addition to efficiently run projects that were always on time and on budget, our team was impressed by the insight that went into the recommendations for resolving issues. Usability Matters consistently outperforms the many usability labs we’ve worked with worldwide. This and that they are just so easy to work with, is why we keep coming back to Usability Matters.”<br>
Paul Booth<br>
(former) Senior Product Manager<br>

<br>
“We’ve been fans of the Usability Matters team for years. Always professional and highly skilled, their information architects blend easily into our project teams, providing effective IA leadership and authority. Our online challenges cover a variety of business models and audiences in the publishing industry. We can count on UM to analyze the competitive landscape, measure customer needs, and design successful experiences.&quot;<br>

“I’ve worked with Usability Matters now on three significant projects, each of which has had different objectives, and I’ve been very impressed in each case. They listened carefully to our needs, provided a cogent analysis of appropriate study methodologies, followed through perfectly on a myriad of details and provided excellent written reports of results and debriefing sessions. These projects helped us articulate the questions we wanted to answer, and the results helped immensely to inform the development of our online user environments.&quot;<br>

“We have been working with the team at Usability Matters for over 4 years now. There are many reasons why they are often amongst the first that come to mind for user experience and strategy projects. They truly care about the end product as much as we do and that shows in all their deliverables. We attribute their success to their collaborative approach that serves as the cherry on top of their core competency in user experience science and design. This is a team that I personally won’t hesitate to recommend because I know they will deliver on their promise.”<br>

“We chose Usability Matters because they work more as a partner than a supplier. They are nimble, timely, responsive, highly experienced, and collaborative.<br>
“They turned a really tricky and multi-faceted challenge into a manageable and timely project with an established process.”<br>
Michael Telpner<br>

&quot;It was a pleasure working with you on this project. The consultations were invaluable to the success of our project and the great feedback we received was a result of your thorough process and expertise. I look forward to further developing the Web site upon your recommendations.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;My web development client was one of the world&#39;s largest marketers and thought they knew everything about their website and their customers. <br>
Usability Matters brought new and invaluable information to them and to the process that couldn&#39;t be obtained by doing the same thing ourselves.&quot;<br>
Neil Mohan<br>
Internet Consultant<br>

<br>
&quot;The reports that Usability Matters produced were nothing short of amazing. Their report format was very easy to read and understand. In virtually all screen-level critiques, they provided a solid wireframe that we could work towards in our development. Most importantly, their report was actionable to the point where we were able to sit with our developer and quickly put together an action plan and new screens. This allowed us to turn-around a new CD-ROM in less than 2 weeks.&quot;<br>
