              </h4>
          
              &quot;For a long time before I joined the sales profession I thought to myself, &quot;I could never be a sales person!&quot; I thought that even though I enjoy working with people, networking and building relationships, selling was a profession meant to be pushy and intended to sell things that people don&#39;t want or need.<br>
<br>
The first time I came to Randy I was new to the sales world; I had no previous sales experience and a lot of head trash. Starting with my first class, I began to notice a dramatic improvement in my approach of sales to the point of which I know thoroughly enjoy it. Every time I learned something new and different and every class I came back to I was eager to learn more and more so I could put it into practice.<br>
<br>
After 1 year of being with Randy I can say that I am so grateful to him; I am so happy I had the chance to take Randy&#39;s course. Randy is excellent in what he does. He is so knowledgeable, well spoken and inspirational and has been a mentor to me in many ways. Even though his classes are implemented for businesses purposes they have also helped me in my own life. Now I know myself better, I know how I behave and am now able to adapt better to others.<br>
<br>
I think becoming competent at sales and following Randy&#39;s teachings is a life learning process. I think this is my first step to a big change in life and I can see it as a turning point in my life which will lead me to something greater. Randy&#39;s teachings have been stuck in my heart and that motivates me to go on and make a difference in my life and the life of others.<br>
<br>
Thank you Randy for your time, your teachings, and your help. I will always be grateful to you and I hope our paths cross again in the future.&quot;<br>

&quot;Randy, I calculated this morning that we had a 97% increase in gross commissions received in quarter one of 2010 over the same period in 2009. Almost all of this income is from business generated since Kevin started working with you in July. Thank you for all your help and patience with both of us. &quot;<br>

&quot;I have been able to consistently take what used to be a 6-8 month sales cycle and bring it to a decision in 2-3 months. The bottom line is that I&#39;ve never enjoyed selling more. It has made my career even more enjoyable.&quot;<br>

&quot;As a small business owner the process of watching our sales force go from dejection and rejection to one of eagerness and success since starting the Sandler Sales System is astounding. The Sandler System is truly different from other sales systems and is vital to businesses that rely on selling.<br>
<br>
On top of that, the time and effort that Randy puts into making sure his students are &quot;getting it&quot; is the attitude and mark of a true professional. Once again thank you.&quot;<br>

&quot;In my career, I have had the opportunity to learn from many professional organizations and schools but I have never gained as much practical management skill as through my time with Randy and the Trainwest Management Team. The improvements in understanding roles, the psychological factors in the sales process and effective communication have helped create not just a more successful sales team, but a more effective group of leaders in our organization. Randy has helped to identify the reality of where we are today and created a better understanding of how we need to behave to achieve our future goals. Randy, on behalf of the team here at the Great Little Box Company, a sincere thank you and we look forward to your continued involvement with helping our organization.&quot;<br>

&quot;Attending Randy&#39;s workshops was a great experience for me. It was great to be able to connect with others in the workshops and listen to them sharing their sales experiences in both their successes and the challenges because its always encouraging to me to know that others experience the same things I do. More importantly, the workshops themselves were very informative and I received practical information and coaching that was immediately applicable. In addition, as we rotated week by week through the various workshops, Randy used a different teaching approach each time a specific topic was repeated which was great in reinforcing learning and at the same time catered to different learning styles - something for everyone. And finally, anyone who has learned and applied the Sandler method of selling knows it works!&quot;<br>

&quot;I wanted to take the time to say thank you. Every third month, as you know, I host a member reception for new and potential members. Randy, you approached us some time ago with an idea to provide our members with some extra value at these receptions in the form of some training.<br>
<br>
Each reception, you came prepared with great insight on how our Chamber members can enjoy networking in a more productive way. They learned methods of first introductions, practiced their &quot;30 Second Commercial,&quot; and you discussed ways to build relationships that would be beneficial to both parties.<br>
<br>
Our members would compliment your presentation by saying the information was relevant, made good sense, truthful and different in some ways to what they knew before. I personally found your presentations refreshing in that we conduct ourselves in a way that is efficient and effective of our time and energy.<br>
<br>
Your interactive approach and confidence as a speaker truly add to the experience. Once again Randy, thank you for your time and training. It is with efforts such as yours that make our Chamber an association where members feel compelled to join and proud to renew.&quot;<br>

&quot;Again, I would like to thank you for the Sales Workshop you presented at our Annual Rendezvous in Vancouver. The quality of information was outstanding and your delivery of the content brought the entire sales process together. In my 30 plus years in this industry I have been fortunate to work for some of the finest transportation companies in North America and have had the opportunity to participate in many sales workshops. To date your presentation has generated more excitement with the participants of the workshop than any I&#39;ve seen.&quot;<br>

&quot;This letter is to express my gratitude and appreciation for the Trainwest course I received from you this year.<br>
<br>
From June 2006 to August 2006, over a period of 6 training sessions on professional sales techniques and the ability to prospect effectively, training was outstanding. The course of one on one training, small classroom setting and on going support was something I had never received in any training in my life. The up-front contracts and dealing with difficult customers were areas I needed more work in and it was such a comfort to know I could call you. You walked me over the phone in a similar scenario that guided me in the direction I needed to go. I am now the 2nd top sales person in the country with my sales at 113% and our year end doesn&#39;t close for another 5 months! Our branch is 2nd in the west and 3rd in the country. I believe this course attributed to mine and our success.<br>
<br>
I still have a lot to learn, but with on going training by you I will grow upwards and onwards with everything I do. This course has taught me as a whole in dealing with business and personal affairs, which I feel has given me a better understanding for the different personalities I deal with each day. People in general, through the techniques of being direct, asking questions, confirming their pain, sitting there without saying a word and listening (this was the hard one) and qualifying them as customers has given me an advantage in increasing my prospect list and my customers respect as I now can get to the matter at heart quicker and more efficiently.<br>
<br>
I find you to be an open, honest, direct, consistent teacher. I like your style. I am learning skills that I never even knew I had. In the future, I look further to developing the skills I am working with now and perfecting the areas which still need some attention, but I know you&#39;re a call away. This course has opened up my eyes to a whole new way of selling and prospecting. I look forward to the Managers Training that I am going to proceed with for myself in the 2007 year.&quot;<br>

&quot;I have been taking the Presidents Club Training for the last 8 months. I have increased sales 20 percent over last year while also increasing profit margin due to Trainwest Training. This is not your typical sales course; this is life training that is not only professional but also personal.<br>
<br>
I always learn something new from Randy and apply it to my daily routine. Since Randy has been in sales for many years he completely understands what we deal with on a daily basis. With his knowledge and expertise he has helped me overcome difficult decisions through providing me with mentoring advice without judging.&quot;<br>

&quot;I have been attending Randy Hnatko&#39;s (Trainwest Management and Consulting Inc.) Presidents Club ongoing Sandler sales training since May 2005. Randy&#39;s ability to share the Sandler methods has been crucial in the start up of our new business. His focus on consistent behaviors is resulting in unprecedented growth and confidence for both our company and myself. He is always there along the way to help reflect on behavior so that being accountable for your actions becomes second nature. No longer do I spend time on &quot;being busy&quot; with things that do not generate income. Randy has indicated many times that my value as a sales professional is determined more by the amount of information I gather than by the amount of information I dispense. All I can say is the Sandler Selling System works! I strongly encourage any one who is starting a new business or is looking for improvements with their sales, or sales team to give Randy a call. Thank you Randy!&quot;<br>

I signed up with Randy after leaving my last company and wanting to transition into more of a direct sales position. Randy was there every step of the way helping me with everything from reworking my resume for greater impact, determining the most appropriate sales position for me based on my DISC profile, interview preparation and more effective questioning during the interview process. For the first time in my life, I didn&#39;t feel that I was at the mercy of the interviewer and that I had to really &quot;sell&quot; myself. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t have any issues with selling myself but the most noticeable effect of Randy&#39;s guidance, was the balance of power present in each of my interviews. Not only was the prospective employer interviewing me, but I too was interviewing them to ensure that the company, their people, the culture and the position were the right fit for me. My whole attitude was different. This approach brought with it added confidence for me which I know came across to the people that were interviewing me. I know that my line of questioning set me apart from other candidates. I start my first direct sales role the first week of October and I must say in looking back over the last three months that I have never enjoyed searching for a new career opportunity more. Without question, the main reason why I feel this way is because I absolutely felt in control of my own destiny throughout the entire process. I attribute a good amount of this confidence and inner strength to all of the guidance and assistance that Randy provided to me and the impact it had on who I am and how I am able to conduct myself going forward, not only during interviews but in other parts of my life as well. I wanted to take my career to the next level and not only have I done that but I have grown immensely as a person as well. Thank you very much Randy!<br>

&quot;This letter is being drafted in recognition of Mr. Randy Hnatko whom was an instrumental player in my successful interviewing process for a much sought after and highly challenging career oriented position.<br>
<br>
Randy prepared me for the said interview by asking me the tough questions, first so that I would be able to mentally prepare myself for those situations beforehand and because of this, my interview went very well with my already understood answers being conveyed to my possible employer.<br>
<br>
With great ease and confidence I would highly recommend Mr. Hnatko to anyone who is seeking a winning edge in their quest for a better career.&quot;<br>

&quot;I knew from the first meeting I had with Randy that the skills he was going to teach me were going to affect not only my career but my personal relationships as well. Learning how to differentiate between I &amp; R (you&#39;ll have to take the course to know what I &amp; R are) was the most valuable part of the course for me. It is easy to not worry and sweat about the small stuff anymore; I now focus only on things that really matter. Randy was and still is a great source of support and encouragement for me now that I have taken on a new career path. The skills he taught in the President&#39;s Club me helped when making the right career changes. On a daily basis I use the skills I have learned from Randy and continue to wow my new employer with my relationship building techniques in dealing with our distributors. Randy as I have said before THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, I wouldn&#39;t be where I am without your classes and wise words of wisdom!&quot;<br>

&quot;As a top producer at Nationwide Insurance, I have been exposed to dozens of training programs. The Sandler Selling System is the most practical and certainly the most effective of all the training material I have used over the years. I have saved thousands of man-hours and increased my income tremendously using the Sandler Selling System.&quot;<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;For a long time before I joined the sales profession I thought to myself, &quot;I could never be a sales person!&quot; I thought that even though I enjoy working with people, networking and building relationships, selling was a profession meant to be pushy and intended to sell things that people don&#39;t want or need.<br>
<br>
The first time I came to Randy I was new to the sales world; I had no previous sales experience and a lot of head trash. Starting with my first class, I began to notice a dramatic improvement in my approach of sales to the point of which I know thoroughly enjoy it. Every time I learned something new and different and every class I came back to I was eager to learn more and more so I could put it into practice.<br>
<br>
After 1 year of being with Randy I can say that I am so grateful to him; I am so happy I had the chance to take Randy&#39;s course. Randy is excellent in what he does. He is so knowledgeable, well spoken and inspirational and has been a mentor to me in many ways. Even though his classes are implemented for businesses purposes they have also helped me in my own life. Now I know myself better, I know how I behave and am now able to adapt better to others.<br>
<br>
I think becoming competent at sales and following Randy&#39;s teachings is a life learning process. I think this is my first step to a big change in life and I can see it as a turning point in my life which will lead me to something greater. Randy&#39;s teachings have been stuck in my heart and that motivates me to go on and make a difference in my life and the life of others.<br>
<br>
Thank you Randy for your time, your teachings, and your help. I will always be grateful to you and I hope our paths cross again in the future.&quot;<br>

&quot;Randy, I calculated this morning that we had a 97% increase in gross commissions received in quarter one of 2010 over the same period in 2009. Almost all of this income is from business generated since Kevin started working with you in July. Thank you for all your help and patience with both of us. &quot;<br>

&quot;I have been able to consistently take what used to be a 6-8 month sales cycle and bring it to a decision in 2-3 months. The bottom line is that I&#39;ve never enjoyed selling more. It has made my career even more enjoyable.&quot;<br>

&quot;As a small business owner the process of watching our sales force go from dejection and rejection to one of eagerness and success since starting the Sandler Sales System is astounding. The Sandler System is truly different from other sales systems and is vital to businesses that rely on selling.<br>
<br>
On top of that, the time and effort that Randy puts into making sure his students are &quot;getting it&quot; is the attitude and mark of a true professional. Once again thank you.&quot;<br>

&quot;In my career, I have had the opportunity to learn from many professional organizations and schools but I have never gained as much practical management skill as through my time with Randy and the Trainwest Management Team. The improvements in understanding roles, the psychological factors in the sales process and effective communication have helped create not just a more successful sales team, but a more effective group of leaders in our organization. Randy has helped to identify the reality of where we are today and created a better understanding of how we need to behave to achieve our future goals. Randy, on behalf of the team here at the Great Little Box Company, a sincere thank you and we look forward to your continued involvement with helping our organization.&quot;<br>

&quot;Attending Randy&#39;s workshops was a great experience for me. It was great to be able to connect with others in the workshops and listen to them sharing their sales experiences in both their successes and the challenges because its always encouraging to me to know that others experience the same things I do. More importantly, the workshops themselves were very informative and I received practical information and coaching that was immediately applicable. In addition, as we rotated week by week through the various workshops, Randy used a different teaching approach each time a specific topic was repeated which was great in reinforcing learning and at the same time catered to different learning styles - something for everyone. And finally, anyone who has learned and applied the Sandler method of selling knows it works!&quot;<br>

&quot;I wanted to take the time to say thank you. Every third month, as you know, I host a member reception for new and potential members. Randy, you approached us some time ago with an idea to provide our members with some extra value at these receptions in the form of some training.<br>
<br>
Each reception, you came prepared with great insight on how our Chamber members can enjoy networking in a more productive way. They learned methods of first introductions, practiced their &quot;30 Second Commercial,&quot; and you discussed ways to build relationships that would be beneficial to both parties.<br>
<br>
Our members would compliment your presentation by saying the information was relevant, made good sense, truthful and different in some ways to what they knew before. I personally found your presentations refreshing in that we conduct ourselves in a way that is efficient and effective of our time and energy.<br>
<br>
Your interactive approach and confidence as a speaker truly add to the experience. Once again Randy, thank you for your time and training. It is with efforts such as yours that make our Chamber an association where members feel compelled to join and proud to renew.&quot;<br>

&quot;Again, I would like to thank you for the Sales Workshop you presented at our Annual Rendezvous in Vancouver. The quality of information was outstanding and your delivery of the content brought the entire sales process together. In my 30 plus years in this industry I have been fortunate to work for some of the finest transportation companies in North America and have had the opportunity to participate in many sales workshops. To date your presentation has generated more excitement with the participants of the workshop than any I&#39;ve seen.&quot;<br>

&quot;This letter is to express my gratitude and appreciation for the Trainwest course I received from you this year.<br>
<br>
From June 2006 to August 2006, over a period of 6 training sessions on professional sales techniques and the ability to prospect effectively, training was outstanding. The course of one on one training, small classroom setting and on going support was something I had never received in any training in my life. The up-front contracts and dealing with difficult customers were areas I needed more work in and it was such a comfort to know I could call you. You walked me over the phone in a similar scenario that guided me in the direction I needed to go. I am now the 2nd top sales person in the country with my sales at 113% and our year end doesn&#39;t close for another 5 months! Our branch is 2nd in the west and 3rd in the country. I believe this course attributed to mine and our success.<br>
<br>
I still have a lot to learn, but with on going training by you I will grow upwards and onwards with everything I do. This course has taught me as a whole in dealing with business and personal affairs, which I feel has given me a better understanding for the different personalities I deal with each day. People in general, through the techniques of being direct, asking questions, confirming their pain, sitting there without saying a word and listening (this was the hard one) and qualifying them as customers has given me an advantage in increasing my prospect list and my customers respect as I now can get to the matter at heart quicker and more efficiently.<br>
<br>
I find you to be an open, honest, direct, consistent teacher. I like your style. I am learning skills that I never even knew I had. In the future, I look further to developing the skills I am working with now and perfecting the areas which still need some attention, but I know you&#39;re a call away. This course has opened up my eyes to a whole new way of selling and prospecting. I look forward to the Managers Training that I am going to proceed with for myself in the 2007 year.&quot;<br>

&quot;I have been taking the Presidents Club Training for the last 8 months. I have increased sales 20 percent over last year while also increasing profit margin due to Trainwest Training. This is not your typical sales course; this is life training that is not only professional but also personal.<br>
<br>
I always learn something new from Randy and apply it to my daily routine. Since Randy has been in sales for many years he completely understands what we deal with on a daily basis. With his knowledge and expertise he has helped me overcome difficult decisions through providing me with mentoring advice without judging.&quot;<br>

&quot;I have been attending Randy Hnatko&#39;s (Trainwest Management and Consulting Inc.) Presidents Club ongoing Sandler sales training since May 2005. Randy&#39;s ability to share the Sandler methods has been crucial in the start up of our new business. His focus on consistent behaviors is resulting in unprecedented growth and confidence for both our company and myself. He is always there along the way to help reflect on behavior so that being accountable for your actions becomes second nature. No longer do I spend time on &quot;being busy&quot; with things that do not generate income. Randy has indicated many times that my value as a sales professional is determined more by the amount of information I gather than by the amount of information I dispense. All I can say is the Sandler Selling System works! I strongly encourage any one who is starting a new business or is looking for improvements with their sales, or sales team to give Randy a call. Thank you Randy!&quot;<br>

I signed up with Randy after leaving my last company and wanting to transition into more of a direct sales position. Randy was there every step of the way helping me with everything from reworking my resume for greater impact, determining the most appropriate sales position for me based on my DISC profile, interview preparation and more effective questioning during the interview process. For the first time in my life, I didn&#39;t feel that I was at the mercy of the interviewer and that I had to really &quot;sell&quot; myself. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t have any issues with selling myself but the most noticeable effect of Randy&#39;s guidance, was the balance of power present in each of my interviews. Not only was the prospective employer interviewing me, but I too was interviewing them to ensure that the company, their people, the culture and the position were the right fit for me. My whole attitude was different. This approach brought with it added confidence for me which I know came across to the people that were interviewing me. I know that my line of questioning set me apart from other candidates. I start my first direct sales role the first week of October and I must say in looking back over the last three months that I have never enjoyed searching for a new career opportunity more. Without question, the main reason why I feel this way is because I absolutely felt in control of my own destiny throughout the entire process. I attribute a good amount of this confidence and inner strength to all of the guidance and assistance that Randy provided to me and the impact it had on who I am and how I am able to conduct myself going forward, not only during interviews but in other parts of my life as well. I wanted to take my career to the next level and not only have I done that but I have grown immensely as a person as well. Thank you very much Randy!<br>

&quot;You have been a great mentor for me. I wouldn&#39;t have been prepared for my interview last week without your training and guidance.

&quot;This letter is being drafted in recognition of Mr. Randy Hnatko whom was an instrumental player in my successful interviewing process for a much sought after and highly challenging career oriented position.<br>
<br>
Randy prepared me for the said interview by asking me the tough questions, first so that I would be able to mentally prepare myself for those situations beforehand and because of this, my interview went very well with my already understood answers being conveyed to my possible employer.<br>
<br>
With great ease and confidence I would highly recommend Mr. Hnatko to anyone who is seeking a winning edge in their quest for a better career.&quot;<br>

&quot;I knew from the first meeting I had with Randy that the skills he was going to teach me were going to affect not only my career but my personal relationships as well. Learning how to differentiate between I &amp; R (you&#39;ll have to take the course to know what I &amp; R are) was the most valuable part of the course for me. It is easy to not worry and sweat about the small stuff anymore; I now focus only on things that really matter. Randy was and still is a great source of support and encouragement for me now that I have taken on a new career path. The skills he taught in the President&#39;s Club me helped when making the right career changes. On a daily basis I use the skills I have learned from Randy and continue to wow my new employer with my relationship building techniques in dealing with our distributors. Randy as I have said before THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, I wouldn&#39;t be where I am without your classes and wise words of wisdom!&quot;<br>

&quot;I recommend Sandler Sales Institute because it&#39;s the best by a country mile. No other selling system can compare! David Sandler developed a system which is the product of raw genius.&quot;<br>

&quot;As a top producer at Nationwide Insurance, I have been exposed to dozens of training programs. The Sandler Selling System is the most practical and certainly the most effective of all the training material I have used over the years. I have saved thousands of man-hours and increased my income tremendously using the Sandler Selling System.&quot;<br>
