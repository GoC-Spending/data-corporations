                            Outcrop is the largest provider of website and new media development in the North.  The range of sites run the gamut from complex territorial - NWT, Yukon and Nunavut - solutions to simple showcase sites for businesses and communities.  We build and maintain 20-30 sites per month using a variety of application tools and languages such as HTML/CSS, Javascript and PHP.  Core project work employs database and open source content management systems such as Wordpress and Drupal.<br>

                            Strategic Goal-Driven Thinking<br>
Theres a universe of difference between strategy and tactics.  Communications and marketing strategies begin with corporate objectives that are transformed into communications goals and then supported by tactics.  Too often, agencies offer tactics and assume that the delivery of those tactics means the job is done.  <br>
Strategy is about outcomes.  Tactics are about outputs.  We never recommend strategy that doesnt support a successful outcome linked to corporate goals.  Communications and marketing arent adjuncts.  Theyre supportive corporate disciplines that can make a difference to an organizations success.<br>
Thats why clients come to Outcrop when they need a strategy; whether its a corporate communications strategy or a marketing strategy, we have the expertise to chart a course that works.<br>
The process begins with research that informs decisions.  You may already have completed research and wed love to review it.  If not, we can deliver a benchmark document that verifies the state of your reputation in the market  with community leaders, employees and other stakeholders  and the gap potential (the share) that should be converted into reputational currency.  Benchmark research is a quick market assessment that enables us (we and you) to get a read on the opportunities for reputational enhancement through effective communications.<br>
Part of the assessment would clarify brand / reputational awareness. Wed recommend a discussion about brand, steeped in messages that speak to who you are rather than what you do:  your values, community commitments, and commitment to employees.  Its a character development analysis.<br>
In the absence of character awareness audiences are left to make their decisions in a vacuum.  That generally means theyll default to the best-known characteristics; i.e. a distant mining company or a faceless bureaucracy, rather than a supportive, contributing member of the community.  We can help build your character share and, in doing so, help to position you more effectively.  Its what we do.<br>
Once benchmark research has been gathered and framed we can build a communications and marketing strategy around it to exploit your advantages / opportunities in a meaningful way for the audiences that offer the greatest potential.  In other words, we focus your communications and marketing investments.<br>

                            There are two very distinct marketing and advertising endeavours in the North:  one urban and the other is remote.  Urban marketing aims to motivate decision makers and opinion leaders and /or target groups with disposable income.  The channels are, as you&#39;d expect, through advertising, collaterals and new media.<br>
But it takes more than slogans and slick ads to motivate remote Northerners.  Yes, the tactics and collaterals are important, but theyre only the outputs supporting the outcomes.<br>
Thats an important distinction that most agencies miss, so clients get major media bills that arent always commensurate with expected results.<br>
The secret to marketing in the North is engagement; if they dont know you or see you often, then they dont care what youre selling or how you package it.   Engagement rules the hearts and minds of Northerners.  Marketing here is a full, body contact sport and an intrinsic part of an effective strategy.<br>
To understand these precepts you have to live and work here.  We do.  You have to know people who know people in communities.  We do.  And you have to put that currency to work for your clients.  We do that too.  Outcrop knows the North.<br>

                            Outcrop has relationships with Aboriginal leadership and communities in all three Territories based on 35 years of northern experience.  We understand the regional and local nuances that effect regulatory / project processes and the need to engage Aboriginal leaders and define their interests early.  We&#39;ve worked with crown corporations and agencies and major mining companies to foster engagement and ongoing success relative to corporate objectives and the Mining Association of Canadas Community of Interest performance indicators. <br>
Outcrop regularly does work for Aboriginal governments and Aboriginal Economic Development Corporations.  Weve planned and delivered community outreach and consultation processes in virtually every region across the North and facilitated workshops with leaders from all small and remote communities.  Our reputation with small communities and Aboriginal leaders over the past three decades is second to none. <br>

                            Strategic Goal-Driven Thinking<br>
Theres a universe of difference between strategy and tactics.  Communications and marketing strategies begin with corporate objectives that are transformed into communications goals and then supported by tactics.  Too often, agencies offer tactics and assume that the delivery of those tactics means the job is done.  <br>
Strategy is about outcomes.  Tactics are about outputs.  We never recommend strategy that doesnt support a successful outcome linked to corporate goals.  Communications and marketing arent adjuncts.  Theyre supportive corporate disciplines that can make a difference to an organizations success.<br>
Thats why clients come to Outcrop when they need a strategy; whether its a corporate communications strategy or a marketing strategy, we have the expertise to chart a course that works.<br>
The process begins with research that informs decisions.  You may already have completed research and wed love to review it.  If not, we can deliver a benchmark document that verifies the state of your reputation in the market  with community leaders, employees and other stakeholders  and the gap potential (the share) that should be converted into reputational currency.  Benchmark research is a quick market assessment that enables us (we and you) to get a read on the opportunities for reputational enhancement through effective communications.<br>
Part of the assessment would clarify brand / reputational awareness. Wed recommend a discussion about brand, steeped in messages that speak to who you are rather than what you do:  your values, community commitments, and commitment to employees.  Its a character development analysis.<br>
In the absence of character awareness audiences are left to make their decisions in a vacuum.  That generally means theyll default to the best-known characteristics; i.e. a distant mining company or a faceless bureaucracy, rather than a supportive, contributing member of the community.  We can help build your character share and, in doing so, help to position you more effectively.  Its what we do.<br>
Once benchmark research has been gathered and framed we can build a communications and marketing strategy around it to exploit your advantages / opportunities in a meaningful way for the audiences that offer the greatest potential.  In other words, we focus your communications and marketing investments.<br>

                            There are two very distinct marketing and advertising endeavours in the North:  one urban and the other is remote.  Urban marketing aims to motivate decision makers and opinion leaders and /or target groups with disposable income.  The channels are, as you&#39;d expect, through advertising, collaterals and new media.<br>
But it takes more than slogans and slick ads to motivate remote Northerners.  Yes, the tactics and collaterals are important, but theyre only the outputs supporting the outcomes.<br>
Thats an important distinction that most agencies miss, so clients get major media bills that arent always commensurate with expected results.<br>
The secret to marketing in the North is engagement; if they dont know you or see you often, then they dont care what youre selling or how you package it.   Engagement rules the hearts and minds of Northerners.  Marketing here is a full, body contact sport and an intrinsic part of an effective strategy.<br>
To understand these precepts you have to live and work here.  We do.  You have to know people who know people in communities.  We do.  And you have to put that currency to work for your clients.  We do that too.  Outcrop knows the North.<br>

                            Outcrop is a thought leader in the Northwest Territories when it comes to Social Media, SEO, web development and gamification. In developing a Communications Plan, we review existing online activities and provide recommendations that will incorporate social media and enhance online presence. <br>
<br>
Outcrop has been invited to deliver talks on social media for the last three years at NWT Tourisms Annual General Meetings and for the Yellowknife Chamber of Commerce. Outcrop has also been published on this topic and is frequently called upon by traditional media for subject matter expertise. Were plugged in to the local and national social media environment to remain current on Internet and New Media trends.<br>

                            Outcrop staff has considerable experience in developing and activating crisis and emergency communication plans for large resource development and industrial and government clients. Working closely with management, plans have been developed that meet stakeholder, public and media accountabilities, as well as responsibilities to communicate with police, emergency services, environmental agencies and local governments.  Outcrop also has real time experience in implementing public and media communications plans during crisis situations involving fire, bomb threats, wildcat strikes, wild well blowouts, crisis of confidence, and injuries/fatalities.    <br>

                            Outcrop has organized, facilitated and staged everything from strategic planning sessions to major successful Northern conferences, like Opportunities North, Prospects North, major mining symposiums, and community consultations.  The secret of our success is the ability to start with the end in mind, quickly map out objectives and deliver events down to the last detail. Weve built strong relationships with local and national media and understand how to attract journalists to create substantial levels of earned awareness related to events.<br>

                            Outcrop has relationships with Aboriginal leadership and communities in all three Territories based on 35 years of northern experience.  We understand the regional and local nuances that effect regulatory / project processes and the need to engage Aboriginal leaders and define their interests early.  We&#39;ve worked with crown corporations and agencies and major mining companies to foster engagement and ongoing success relative to corporate objectives and the Mining Association of Canadas Community of Interest performance indicators. <br>
Outcrop regularly does work for Aboriginal governments and Aboriginal Economic Development Corporations.  Weve planned and delivered community outreach and consultation processes in virtually every region across the North and facilitated workshops with leaders from all small and remote communities.  Our reputation with small communities and Aboriginal leaders over the past three decades is second to none. <br>
