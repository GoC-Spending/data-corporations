                            We know what’s required, and we excel at finding ways to match those requirements with project goals. You could say we know a little something about the environment. Our passion for it drives our work. When we’re gathering data to permit a new facility or collaborating on a plan to remediate an old one, we’re helping find the balance between progress and protection. Out in the field, we take time to understand the site. When we know the conditions, we can make recommendations that minimize or eliminate changes for you. Safety is also key: the ongoing commitment we’ve made to safety procedures extends from personal protective equipment to the Green Hand program for training our new field staff. Grounded by safety, quality, and ethics, we come up with solutions that perfectly fit the site. Whether it’s preparing a complex permit application, monitoring a site during construction, or designing a decommissioning plan, our team’s got the environment down to a science.<br>

                            You know what’s in front of and around you. There’s comfort in that. So we partner with airports all over to make sure that safety and security is there, for pilots and passengers alike. Through our design of airfield approach lighting systems and navigational aids (NAVAIDs), the operational and safety characteristics of an airport are greatly enhanced. Our airport electrical engineers are recognized for their expertise and experience in airfield lighting, electrical vault design/upgrade, approach lighting systems, NAVAIDs, and airfield lighting control and monitoring systems. And we don’t stop there. We’ve assisted in the update and revisions of various Federal Aviation Association (FAA) Advisory Circulars pertaining to airfield electrical design standards. Similar services were provided to U.S. Department of Defense officials in related military design manuals.<br>

                            This is what today’s passenger expects, so an effective and attractive retail program is an important part of any modern commercial airport terminal. The ingredients for success are simple—blend award-winning airport terminal design expertise with proven experience in high-visibility, high-impact, and high-performance retail design. Few companies have what it takes to successfully combine these ingredients. We do. From the retail master plan to the individual tenant design guidelines, we know how to create places where passengers can relax over a meal or drink, make a few purchases, or rejuvenate with a massage. Our concession planning approach puts the right mix of stores in the right places, in a way that celebrates local culture while complementing the airport’s design. The result? An airport that elevates the passenger experience while maximizing revenue potential. <br>

                            We know airports. And we know retail. So we know that successful airport retail store design needs to draw from both pools of knowledge, equally. Even within a single airport, signage zones, storefront feature zones, blade signs and closure lines take on different meanings in pre-security and post-security areas, and in stores that are located within holdrooms versus in-line food and beverage installations. Passengers passing through each of these areas have different priorities, which lead to different dwell times and flow routes. We design stores for airports, stores that understand passengers. To draw in passengers, airport stores must successfully project their own brand identity while respecting the local circumstances and brand identity of the airport. We believe that airport retail programs can successfully combine global brands with local flair and flavor. Our services, from award-winning interior design to image branding and development, make airport retail work.<br>

                            “Getting there is half the fun,” right? The right airport can complement a great travel experience by making it easy for passengers to find their way through check-in, bag drop, security, and to their gate, and by providing opportunities to eat, shop, and relax along the way. We don’t just design the terminal, we design the entire passenger experience. That’s why our airport designs consistently rank in the top 10 in independent passenger satisfaction surveys. We integrate important features directly into our designs, like intuitive wayfinding, art installations, and retail, food, and beverage facilities that deliver the level of quality and variety that sophisticated customers expect. We collaborate with our clients and all airport stakeholders—passengers, airlines, authorities having jurisdiction, tenants, and the local community—whether we’re designing a renovation, expansion, or new terminal building. And when it’s time to build, we know how to plan the work for the least possible disruption to airport operations. We can’t control missed connections or weather delays, but when your passengers are “stuck at the airport,” we do all we can to make sure they don’t feel that way.<br>

                            Which is why it takes such specialized engineering skill to ensure each take off occurs without incident. At Stantec, we work hard to keep every leg of the passenger journey safe and efficient. We design runways, taxiways, and aprons; lighting and navigational aids; and refueling systems; and perform safety area studies and upgrades; utility engineering, and pavement management studies with the passenger first and foremost in our minds. We’re always looking for improved ways of doing things. As part of our spearheading of research and development to study the potential benefits of using Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) on airport construction projects, we recently prepared a special study at Logan International Airport on the environmental benefits and construction efficiencies of using WMA pavements. Keeping airports open and safe during these projects is essential, and we create logical and realistic phasing plans that reduce impacts to airport operations, all while making safety a priority.<br>

                            Healthcare is a risky business. When expanding or renovating your buildings, speed and cost control is the name of the game. Stantec has successfully deployed a variety of strategies for project delivery: CM at risk, design-build, Integrated Project Delivery (IPD), and design/build/finance/operate. Combined with our use of Building Information Modeling (BIM), our IPD experience has demonstrated significant improvements in construction and design outcomes. We apply many of the beneficial IPD principles to each of the delivery systems including collaborative decision-making, early involvement of key participants, intensified early planning, open and enhanced communication, and jointly developed and validated targets. We think nobody has done more Public-Private Partnerships (P3) or alternative-finance procurements in healthcare than we have. Our P3 and private finance initiative healthcare experience includes $7 billion in construction as an owner’s advisor and $3 billion in construction as the proponent’s designer across Canada, US, UK, and Australia.<br>

                            And we’re always thinking of ways to make that trip more efficient, more accurate, and safer. From conveyor design restraints to sorting and screening requirements, from coordination with existing building systems to accommodating future terminal system expansion, we’ve met the challenges that make baggage system design so specialized. We use that understanding to create solutions that meet the financial, functional, and operational goals of airport designers, operators, airlines, and other stakeholders. Feasibility studies. Structural analysis. Simulation modeling. We use the most effective tools to incorporate the design of baggage systems seamlessly into the early planning stages of an airport terminal project; this means baggage system design is integrated into every design decision. So relax. We’ve got baggage.<br>

                            We see the opportunity through BIM to effectively engage the client, project team, and stakeholders and to produce better coordinated and integrated design solutions. It’s the key to unlocking your building’s potential. Using this powerful technology, we can help you move your project forward, improve your operations, and capitalize on opportunities. BIM can influence how designers, builders, and owners approach collaboration, processes, information exchange, technology, and design. The power of BIM is the ability to link parametric data to virtual 3D objects. To take full advantage of this technology, one should think of it as a collection of data that defines a project. Leveraging this data (the “I” in BIM) is the key to optimizing the benefits of BIM.<br>

                            We create communities by planning, developing, designing, and implementing the infrastructure needed to sustain their growth. Designing these components is best described as controlling the horizontal and vertical features of the infrastructure you see at ground level, and the infrastructure you can’t see underground. Our civil engineers are involved in specifying and designing streets, sidewalks, water supply networks, sewers, municipal solid waste management and disposal, and stormwater management. Although standards and best practices provide guidance for the design of civil infrastructure, each project has its own unique challenges. Each site is different, and the restrictions can range from vertical terrain issues to a lack of existing infrastructure for new development. We analyze every project and recommend the best approach for completing a competent design that also makes sense. Watch us dig in to find new techniques and software programs, and loop in our extensive resource pool to tackle the issues. Some call it drive, but the bottom line is we’re open to new ideas and techniques that will help provide you with optimal results.<br>

                            For existing buildings, our in-house evaluation is used to reveal how much energy a facility is currently consuming then identifies ways to reduce energy and water usage. We establish realistic reduction targets, along with a host of conservation strategies. Working together, we’ll evaluate each strategy against your building’s unique circumstances to select the most reasonable options. This includes recommendations for improvements, probable costs, and plans for ongoing rate monitoring. For new buildings, we use energy modeling to predict consumption levels. Together, we’ll establish reduction goals and apply methods to conserve energy facility wide. Our customized modeling considers the operations at individual plants. Interestingly, two facilities owned by the same company may have differing procedures. We recognize that fact. Every energy model we develop is custom to your specific facility and process. Often the largest potential savings is in the process equipment and operation. We leverage years of process experience to optimize the potential in your process. We understand the energy related issues in the built environment. Our customized audits, energy engineering, commissioning, and analyses can help your facility personnel to operate the building with optimum efficiency, and in turn realize significant operational savings.<br>

                            We share your value that the safety of employees, customers, visitors, and the community at large is a crucial element in the design of science and technology facilities. Value motivates us every day as we develop appropriate measures to manage the hazardous materials that are used in your labs and manufacturing facilities. While the proper use and storage of hazardous materials is required by building codes for laboratory, science, and biopharmaceutical facilities, we know that hazardous material management is the right thing to do, a critical safety consideration within science and technology buildings. Intrinsic to planning and design, the safe use and storage of hazardous materials is expected, and we deliver on that expectation through our extensive knowledge and experience with building codes and standards, with building construction, with integrated design of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, and with creative problem solving. We are driven not only by your values but also by our own core values, the first of which is building long-standing relationships with our clients by communicating openly and viewing each project as a unique entity. <br>

                            When mechanical engineers work with architects right from the start to incorporate mechanical systems into the design of highly complex research and science buildings, that’s integrated design. This approach to science and technology design benefits everyone, from our clients, to the community of users, to every one of us who has or will ever need a cutting-edge medical treatment or cure. That’s a tall order, but it is indeed at the very heart of our integrated design services, particularly for facilities in which highly controlled heating and ventilation, flexibility, and energy efficiency are critical. Integrating complex mechanical systems with architectural elements in the initial building design not only saves energy, costs and space, but also creates a more organized, better functioning system so that critical research and information is not lost, even in emergencies. Building strong partnerships is as important as building state-of-the-art mechanical systems. The trust and collaboration that those relationships require are what help us address the challenges of our work in these unique buildings. <br>

                            That’s why the infrastructure surrounding an airport – the roadways, parking lots and garages, walkways, and hangars – and the infrastructure underneath the airport (utilities and drainage) are so important. They’re often the first thing your passengers experience, and we want that first impression to be positive and lasting. We make it easier to start the journey. We’ve developed bypasses and roundabouts, urban connectors and intersection upgrades for many primary, secondary, and local roadways along with upgraded access for numerous airports. No one’s getting lost on our watch. And we look at the whole site, completing engineering analyses to identify existing on-site and off-site utilities. The potential for system upgrades to meet current and future project demands. Efficient utility corridors. We give the same scrutiny to parking facilities, creating spaces that welcome passengers, make them feel secure as they leave their vehicles to begin the next phase of their journey. We understand the need to create a seamless travel experience from landside to airside and, safely home again. <br>

                            To appreciate the importance of light, it’s important to understand why and how people use a space. We design architectural lighting solutions for projects ranging from urban streets to high-end retail, signature performing arts centers to world-class museums and beyond. In every project, light is located with care, using human perception as our guide. With light, we create safer, more appealing spaces that fulfill functional needs and go further, giving life, vitality and spirit to neighborhoods and communal gathering spots. Deeply committed to sustainable solutions – energy-conscious planning, daylighting and preserving the nighttime sky are just a few of our strategies to improve resource use while demonstrating greater respect for the environment. <br>

                            You get to see a variety of routes before you have to commit to any one in particular, and you might even find roadways that you didn’t know existed, opening up new opportunities and enhancing your trip. When clients recognize the need for new, expanded or upgraded facilities involving either renovations or new construction, but need help envisioning exactly how to proceed, we listen very carefully and develop a master plan to assist in realizing goals. Depending on what we learn from you, as well as from your users, we develop a customized master plan. Additionally, with our technical expertise in master planning and a thorough understanding of relevant codes, regulations, engineering, and environmentally responsible requirements, we can help you to envision a wide range of possibilities. Understanding is crucial to a successful master plan. We know that deciding which alternate is best often involves more than costs and schedules. To assist you in this regard, we develop a decision making matrix that identifies the project attributes that best describe a successful project. <br>

                            We create the mathematical model of the manufacturing process and use that model to simulate the process over a range of scenarios, allowing accurate forecasting of the effects of design decisions. In this way, we can optimize designs, de-bottleneck the process, and evaluate the impact of throughput changes or process modifications. Better still, our clients not only gain a fuller understanding of their process and project, but also avoid the unintended consequences that often result from seemingly innocuous issues. Because we are process designers, we understand process design issues. The hardest part of this effort is tech transfer – getting full disclosure of what is going on in the process. To overcome this challenge, we use an extensive set of tools to collect process information from owners, and we conduct interactive model review sessions to validate the model against reality. The creation of the model is not the end goal – an optimized design is. <br>

                            Extreme weather events like Katrina, Irene, Sandy, and the Alberta floods—plus droughts, economic downturns, infrastructure decay, aging populations, hackers, earthquakes, terrorism, and more—draw our attention to a growing movement in architecture and engineering: resilience. So what do we talk about when we talk about resilience? We believe resilience is the capacity of people, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems to endure, adapt, and thrive regardless of chronic stresses and acute shocks that occur. Stantec’s work—professional consulting in disaster response and recovery, resilience assessment, mitigation, and design—unites infrastructure, environmental, and quality of life improvements to advance community resilience across the globe. We deploy emerging approaches such as the planning and assessment tool Envision to help our communities evaluate, measure, and track progress towards resiliency.<br>

                            Whether a new development or renewal, we provide consulting services at every scale of the built, natural and organizational environments. Whether you are interested in LEED®, Green Globes, BREEAM or you’re just interested in becoming more sustainable, we have a team of experts ready to advise and guide you through the process. We’re thinking about how to leverage alternate energy systems design, building performance analysis, daylighting strategies, energy audits, efficient lighting systems design, energy performance and modeling, green roofs, grey and black water systems, indoor environmental assessments, life cycle costing, natural ventilation design, photovoltaics, solar and wind energy, to change our future. Why? Because if the building stock in North America were upgraded to achieve a 20% reduction in potable water consumption we could save 3 trillion gallons of water, because if we all used mugs or glasses versus paper cups we could save more than 52 million trees annually, because 1,265 lives could be saved each year if a 20% increase in daylighting in hospitals resulted in just a 1% reduction in medical errors. We’re making a difference, one project at a time – for ours and future generations. <br>

                            Technology is the invisible thread that connects each of us to the world around us. It brings efficiency to our infrastructure and buildings, to our processes and increasingly shapes the way we experience the world. Information and communications technology (ICT) integrates telecommunications, intelligent building management systems, security and audio-visual systems. Though you may not see it, every building that you step into employs ICT through security and fire alarm management, audio and video processing, transmission and network based control, even the telephone and internet. Why is ICT important? Smarter buildings can operate more efficiently, improve operational efficiency and provide the enabled environments which fuels discovery and innovation. Increasingly it is technology that connects us to each other and to the broader world around us. It is changing the way we do business, receive care, teach, learn and travel from A to B. What does the future hold? We believe, it has unlimited possibility - with smarter buildings and infrastructure to connect us, raise awareness and transform business operations. Let us show you how.<br>

                            Through design visualization, clients and stakeholders can picture the building they’ll work in, the bridge they’ll drive over, the neighborhood their kids will play in, and the campus that becomes a home away from home. Changes to design can be seen and understood immediately. When the project stakeholders can envision the end result of the design work, community excitement and project support builds. With our in-house team of filmmakers, animators, 3D modelers, and application engineers, we can produce a range of products, from cinematic photorealistic films and building renderings, to data-driven facility fly-throughs. These tools help clients, stakeholders, and others involved in the process to quickly gain an understanding of the design direction, upon which solid solutions can be built. <br>

                            On, above, and below the earth’s surface – we provide surveying and mapping to define land boundaries, earth’s physical features, and the built environment. Armed with tools like GPS, GIS, 3D laser scanners, and aerial photogrammetry, we deliver innovative solutions for remote and challenging environments or complex urban settings. Our projects are as broad as the places we work including residential, industrial, highway, rail, aviation, utility and power, environmental, oil and gas, federal, and institutional. Geomatics is the science of collection, analysis, display, and management of spatial information. The art is interpreting this information for legal matters of land definition or to support mapping, design, or construction activities. Addressing unique logistical and technical aspects of each project, our experts offer services that include boundary and cadastral surveys, topographic mapping, construction staking, residential builder layout, ALTA/ACSM surveys, 3D laser scanning, geodetic and control surveys, route surveys, as-built surveys, aerial photogrammetric mapping, water rights surveys, hydrographic/bathometric mapping, and subsurface utility engineering.<br>

                            Change often comes with stress and uncertainty. Our public participation specialists work with our clients to develop and implement communication and consultation plans that allow people affected by change to understand, influence, and accept it. When a new development is planned or new building built, the community wants to know how it will affect traffic, the environment, and their daily lives. When a new park is planned, users want to be involved to create a space that meets their needs. By being involved from the conceptual stage of a project, we raise awareness and understanding of the project’s impact, define and manage expectations, and build trusting relationships between those impacted by the project and those building it. We use traditional and non-traditional methods from public meetings, focus groups, and open houses to web surveys and social media to share information and ensure all affected groups have a say in a forum that works for them. In doing so, views and concerns can be expressed to inform decision-making and build consensus. The result is a project that is viable and more likely to be accepted by a community that feels like it had a voice.<br>

                            Urban design represents a unique way of looking at the towns and cities where we work: In the midst of economic and social change, we identify opportunities to improve livability, expand economic opportunity and equity, and promote environmental responsibility. We help our clients clarify values and craft visions both achievable and compelling. Our plans and designs advance community visions beautifully—whether for a Main Street, a neighborhood, or an entire downtown—but they also pay off in other ways. When Transit Oriented Developments lift real estate values, a community gains jobs and new revenues that can underwrite more affordable housing. When Complete Streets invite people to leave their car at home and walk, bike or use transit, then public health gets a boost and our carbon footprint shrinks. When imaginative design turns a brownfield into a leafy riverbank park, or a seawall into an elegant esplanade, quality of life rises and environmental threats recede. Our urban design team creates spaces, networks and infrastructure that connect people to each other and equip communities to thrive socially, economically and environmentally.<br>

                            We transform land into real projects – a fit between physical site conditions, public expectations, fiscal requirements, and environmental constraints. From residential and commercial developments to industrial, recreational, resort, and institutional projects, our experience is broad. Our site and infrastructure solutions are key to the financial viability of a project and innovative infrastructure and stormwater management solutions not only form the framework for the site, they help define the final design. Using technology to enhance our design and implementation skills, we save our clients money and increase their return on investment. Whether for a new phase, new neighbourhood, or new city, we offer services that add value to a project including infrastructure design, construction observation, contract administration, land and earthworks analysis, stormwater management, and studies for feasibility, servicing, drainage, property development potential. Creating solutions that are environmentally responsible, functional, and technically sound, we are shaping the landscape of our communities. <br>

                            Tree-ring analysis (dendrochronology) can be interpreted alongside historical documents with surprising accuracy. Suddenly it’s not abandoned anymore, but a home with a history that can be recorded and preserved. Heritage resources include precontact, historic, and palaeontological sites, which are protected under provincial/state, territorial, and federal legislation. During one archaeological assessment we looked at over 5,000 artifacts and two structures from 2,500 to 3,000 years ago. We practice respectful collection and interpretation of information and share past and present cultural diversity with future generations. Studying the predecessors of today’s animals is equally as informative. A toothed whale (odontecetes) might be from the early Miocene Epoch, but we can easily imagine what it looked like. Without paleontology though, we could never envision a Tyrannosaurus Rex. In reality, we wouldn’t even know he existed. Bone, half a metre in length, can lie buried underneath your feet for thousands of years, without notice. Stantec is working with developers to ensure that we can build new and preserve old.<br>

                            When we work with you to prepare permit applications and environmental assessments, the primary goal is to obtain sufficient information to meet regulatory requirements. We provide permitting strategy, environmental assessment and application preparation, and technical support for projects requiring municipal, provincial/state and federal environmental approvals and licenses. We have excellent working relationships with regulatory agencies throughout North America and these relationships help us to create an effective approach to securing regulatory approvals. Early identification of constraints, client goals, regulatory agency needs, and stakeholder issues allows us to address problems before they can knock a project off course. Solid, defensible applications need data to back them up. Stantec has the in-house expertise and experience in collecting and analyzing data on the atmospheric, aquatic, terrestrial, and socioeconomic environments for input to environmental assessments and regulatory applications. From there, we can design management and monitoring programs for the life of a project.<br>

                            Impact assessments look more deeply at the effects on human receptors. Specialists model and measure releases into the atmosphere using approved techniques from federal and state/provincial guidelines. By modeling worst and alternate case scenarios for you, we can help create an overall risk communication plan. Specifically, dispersion and odour models factor in emissions, weather data, and terrain profiles to develop management strategies for air quality. Indoor air quality investigations address nuisance odours, mold, and unexplained illnesses from occupants. Acoustical/noise analysis helps uncover the best noise control options by reviewing source and terrain conditions. Renderings and baseline light measurements help determine facility lighting that is more efficient, and less visible. Across energy and resource, infrastructure, and building sectors, atmospheric analyses assist in establishing optimal operating conditions for facilities experiencing atmospheric releases. <br>

                            Our aquatic and wildlife biologists, plant ecologists, engineers, hydrologists, geomorphologists, and other specialists aren’t afraid to look outside the norm to address the impairments in a way that builds on the strengths of the unique environment. Working with provincial/state and federal agencies, restoring ecosystem functionality is our goal when we examine the leftover parts of a disturbed natural system and decide how it should fit back together. We have leading experts in all types of ecosystems, ranging from coastal systems to rivers and lakes; prairies to uplands and forests; and boreal forests to alpine and arctic environments. In the energy and resources sectors, reclamation of large scale disturbances is a critical component of life-cycle management. We can help you design for closure in tandem with your development and operation activities, keeping in mind traditional use and traditional knowledge. We make it our mission to understand the purpose and to tailor our design, whether it’s a dam removal, river restoration, or site reclamation. <br>

                            Covering everything from screening level to comprehensive risk assessments, we help you develop site-specific criteria for the management of potential health concerns. When chemical concentrations exceed standards set by provincial/state/federal authorities, decisions have to be made. The presence of a chemical in excess of a guideline doesn’t mean that adverse effects to health will occur, but does suggest further evaluation. At sites where cleanup to generic criteria levels would be costly, we provide the technical resources to develop site-specific criteria instead. By reassessing the assumptions used in the generic criteria or generating site-specific toxicological data we can create custom clean-up levels. For sites with ecological risk we use in-house terrestrial toxicology laboratories to seamlessly incorporate bioassessibility and terrestrial toxicity testing. The underlying health risk assessment principles for planned projects are very similar to contaminated sites and look at exposure to contaminants in soil, sediment, water, air, and food.<br>

                            We go beyond “working” with the mining industry. We share our perspectives, values, and knowledge, and in the process, create a community behind a project. We are biologists, geologists, archeologists, hydrologists, engineers, geochemists, regulatory experts, risk assessors, and toxicologists. Our roles may differ, but together we share the land and the resources we mine. Our experience allows us to think of creative solutions for addressing regulatory, environmental, and community challenges in gold, silver, nickel, copper, zinc, coal, platinum, aggregate, diamonds, uranium, or potash mining operations. At all stages—exploration, planning, operations, closure—we work to keep your projects moving forward safely, and ensure the natural environment is preserved for generations to come. <br>

                            We’ve been providing field services for more than 15 years, with an experienced team who specializes in this type of work. So we know that lack of reliable and accessible engineering information for operating assets can decrease your ability to optimize or manage risk. Our team provides detailed field verification (as-building), critical drawing maintenance programs, metering and measurement. Detailed as-built drawings ensure that proper Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) reviews, site integrity reviews, future engineering designs as well as management of change (MOC) occurs on the most current version of critical engineering documentation. A drawing maintenance program will ensure that drawings are maintained and your initial project investment is protected. <br>

                            We look at how flow and volume in oceans, rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands can be impacted during project construction or operation and how it might affect growth, reproduction, bioenergetics, or survival of aquatic communities. By documenting existing conditions and determining potential impacts we develop avoidance and mitigation measures that are cost-effective but ensure protection of fish, aquatic invertebrates, and vegetation. Projects can also affect water quality. Our scientists, biologists, and technical staff use analytical chemistry and their toxicological expertise to study effects of organic and inorganic contaminants and emerging chemicals of concern. We maintain our own labs for taxonomic identification and sample processing of invertebrates and collaborate with academic partners to find new ways to measure and protect water quality. Based on our experience with power, transportation, mining, oil &amp; gas, and federal/state/provincial work, we help you create viable projects that show how development and nature can coexist.<br>

                            Whether through a Web portal or a geographic information system (GIS), we take data from multiple sources, work on it in layers, and create something unique to your requirements. With surprising speed, the numbers turn into maps that can represent key water crossings or setbacks, place species habitat concerns, and show property lines. Bringing all possible constraints to one place gets a discussion going. And because it’s virtual, we can change parameters to find the right project layout. 3-D models will help you experience the site, before and after. We design secure Web portals or custom databases to collect, manage, and help you use information to make business decisions. Today, you need effective IM solutions to meet government guidelines. A needs assessment captures the vision of how technology can support your core objectives without reinventing process or spending a lot of money. So whether it’s tracking public consultation comments, monitoring compliance, or designing an interactive map for land parcels, our conveyor belt will smooth out the production process.<br>

                            As projects in energy and resource, building, and infrastructure sectors move into closer proximity with existing developments and land-uses, public concerns are likely to increase. Taking time to learn more about our shared history builds stronger connections with our communities. By partnering with Aboriginal community members when we’re tracking wildlife or monitoring vegetation for an assessment, we open a window into traditional knowledge. Our field crews learn to identify plants with traditional uses and see places of cultural significance. And socio-economic specialists work with local residents to ensure communities are not only undamaged, but benefit in sustainable ways. When we feel connected as a community, we work better together.<br>

                            Our site investigation and instrumentation services are extensive and at the forefront of the industry. We are continuously evaluating new site investigation technology along with time-tested, proven methods. By combining these methods we’re confident in our designs and analyses. Whether you want to remotely keep an eye on the water levels in a high hazard dam embankment or ensure your new home is situated on stable ground, our engineers have the experience for this and everything in between. Our field inspectors and engineers are highly experienced in observing auger drilling, mud rotary, rock coring and many types of sampling. We understand the complex downhole situations that occur during the drilling process and can manage site investigations with multiple crews and challenging site conditions. We train our staff to work safely and to identify and correct safety concerns before they turn into incidents. Our end goal is to ensure site conditions are well understood and capture the necessary detail for engineering analyses that follow.<br>

                            Planning is problem solving. It starts with a vision to improve our communities balanced with a promise to treat our land responsibly. To create careful and thoughtful options for right now as well as for the future, we take into account site conditions, public input, client needs, and project requirements. Through a collaborative process, we listen to the ideas of the community members and the goals of the stakeholders to provide creative solutions for our most precious and limited commodity — land. We facilitate positive outcomes that satisfy the needs of clients and approval agencies alike. It’s about understanding the value of process, successful conflict resolution, collaboration and consensus building among all key stakeholders, while never losing sight of the goal to safeguard our natural resources. Because we live in the communities we serve, we feel strongly about responsible land planning. Our goal is to enhance the welfare of people and their communities by creating convenient, equitable, healthful, efficient, and attractive environments for present and future generations. <br>

                            We can do this because our team members have been in the industry for years. We’ve worked hard to earn the respect and trust of clients like Kinder Morgan, Caiman, Enbridge, Chesapeake, and Boardwalk Field Services. When we design a pipeline route, we take into account the environmental considerations, regulatory requirements, and your project goals before we hit the field. We know your project is on a tight schedule and budget, so the less time we can spend rerouting, the closer you get to a completed project. Our team will produce all the documents you need to get your pipeline in the ground and operating – construction alignment sheets, permit drawings, easement plats and engineering design drawings. Once you start construction, we’ll be there to ensure it gets built right. We’ll manage the construction activities, prepare the as-built survey, and the final as-built drawings. We take the best route, combining industry expertise with local knowledge to get it done right the first time. <br>

                            A teenager riding his bike over a major roadway by way of a multi-use path and pedestrian bridge. A man taking the train to visit his grandchildren. Different people, but with a shared goal: to get from Point A to Point B as quickly and safely as possible. We create the connections that get people and goods from here to there – whether by car, bus, train, plane, or their own two feet. Working within the context of the communities we serve, we provide planning, engineering, and infrastructure management services that fit the needs of our clients and improve the overall traveler experience. From major expressway and rural roadway projects to bridge rehabilitations, transit systems, and airport design, our focus is always on providing solutions that respect the local environment. And for us, simply engineering the various components of a transportation network doesn’t equal success. We also need to meet the needs of the people traveling every day. Because Stantec isn’t just a company; we’re people, with the same goals as everyone else – to get where we’re going, safely and efficiently.<br>

                            The need for geotechnical services is everywhere, so we work in a variety of sectors across North America for new commercial and institutional sites, transportation facilities, flood control structures, mining developments, near shore and offshore structures, renewable energy developments, utility expansions, and water storage projects. Our services include traditional geotechnical applications, such as settlement, slope stability, seepage analyses, and foundation and retaining wall design. But what sets Stantec apart is the value-added services we provide in numerical modeling, deep foundation evaluations, seismic engineering, risk-based engineering and associated economic analyses, and other related design services. To us, succeeding means providing creative solutions to the people we work with, on schedule and within budget. We stay at the forefront of the industry to make sure your community improvements are built on solid ground.<br>

                            Whether it comes to numerical modeling, seepage and stability analyses, design of machine foundations or nearly any other type of engineering analyses, we have professional staff that can help. We’re skilled at helping our clients understand soil-structure interaction. We focus on the interaction of soil and rock with structures, whether it’s supporting a residence on spread foundations, a heavily-loaded structure on deep foundations, or a dam or levee on native soils and bedrock. Our geotechnical and civil engineers interpret the findings of site investigations and laboratory testing as a basis to analyze and quantify the interaction of a proposed structure with the ground. In support of these analyses, we frequently utilize computer software to assess multiple modes of soil-structure interaction under design load cases relevant to the structure’s performance. <br>

                            How safe is the ground beneath your feet? Geohazards are geological conditions that may lead to localized or widespread damage to property and threaten personal safety. From immediate hazards to longer-term risks, our geotechnical specialists assess risk factors and manage threats from landslides, earthquakes and seismicity, rock falls, slope instability, shallow gas accumulation, sink holes, ground subsidence and erosive forces. We work with clients to protect infrastructure such as roadways, homes, sewers and pipelines, as well as natural environments such as wetlands, valley systems and beaches. We use detailed field reconnaissance, intrusive site investigation and instrumentation together with geophysical and remote sensing techniques to identify hazards. We assess these risks using local experience and sophisticated modeling, partnered with our team focus on effective listening and open communication. <br>

                            Even with sound engineering design and construction practice, changing ground conditions can negatively impact a project. Buildings settle or heave, basements leak, slopes fail, buried pipes break or collapse, walls crack, and sink holes appear. That’s where we come in. Our geotechnical team analyzes distresses and failures related, in whole or in part, to ground conditions. We carefully examine technical aspects of the project, the location and surrounding infrastructure. We’ll explore the history of the project, engineering design, construction methodologies and procedures, and operation and maintenance practices. Understanding the rules that direct design and construction and the contractual responsibilities among involved parties is a critical part of our work. Based on our analyses, we can determine causes of problems and define and assign appropriate level of legal responsibility. We regularly consult with experts and regulatory authorities, review contract documents and specifications, consult with and advise counsel in advance of legal proceedings, and provide expert witness and testimony in court. <br>

                            We know what’s required, and we excel at finding ways to match those requirements with project goals. You could say we know a little something about the environment. Our passion for it drives our work. When we’re gathering data to permit a new facility or collaborating on a plan to remediate an old one, we’re helping find the balance between progress and protection. Out in the field, we take time to understand the site. When we know the conditions, we can make recommendations that minimize or eliminate changes for you. Safety is also key: the ongoing commitment we’ve made to safety procedures extends from personal protective equipment to the Green Hand program for training our new field staff. Grounded by safety, quality, and ethics, we come up with solutions that perfectly fit the site. Whether it’s preparing a complex permit application, monitoring a site during construction, or designing a decommissioning plan, our team’s got the environment down to a science.<br>

                            You know what’s in front of and around you. There’s comfort in that. So we partner with airports all over to make sure that safety and security is there, for pilots and passengers alike. Through our design of airfield approach lighting systems and navigational aids (NAVAIDs), the operational and safety characteristics of an airport are greatly enhanced. Our airport electrical engineers are recognized for their expertise and experience in airfield lighting, electrical vault design/upgrade, approach lighting systems, NAVAIDs, and airfield lighting control and monitoring systems. And we don’t stop there. We’ve assisted in the update and revisions of various Federal Aviation Association (FAA) Advisory Circulars pertaining to airfield electrical design standards. Similar services were provided to U.S. Department of Defense officials in related military design manuals.<br>

                            This is what today’s passenger expects, so an effective and attractive retail program is an important part of any modern commercial airport terminal. The ingredients for success are simple—blend award-winning airport terminal design expertise with proven experience in high-visibility, high-impact, and high-performance retail design. Few companies have what it takes to successfully combine these ingredients. We do. From the retail master plan to the individual tenant design guidelines, we know how to create places where passengers can relax over a meal or drink, make a few purchases, or rejuvenate with a massage. Our concession planning approach puts the right mix of stores in the right places, in a way that celebrates local culture while complementing the airport’s design. The result? An airport that elevates the passenger experience while maximizing revenue potential. <br>

                            We know airports. And we know retail. So we know that successful airport retail store design needs to draw from both pools of knowledge, equally. Even within a single airport, signage zones, storefront feature zones, blade signs and closure lines take on different meanings in pre-security and post-security areas, and in stores that are located within holdrooms versus in-line food and beverage installations. Passengers passing through each of these areas have different priorities, which lead to different dwell times and flow routes. We design stores for airports, stores that understand passengers. To draw in passengers, airport stores must successfully project their own brand identity while respecting the local circumstances and brand identity of the airport. We believe that airport retail programs can successfully combine global brands with local flair and flavor. Our services, from award-winning interior design to image branding and development, make airport retail work.<br>

                            “Getting there is half the fun,” right? The right airport can complement a great travel experience by making it easy for passengers to find their way through check-in, bag drop, security, and to their gate, and by providing opportunities to eat, shop, and relax along the way. We don’t just design the terminal, we design the entire passenger experience. That’s why our airport designs consistently rank in the top 10 in independent passenger satisfaction surveys. We integrate important features directly into our designs, like intuitive wayfinding, art installations, and retail, food, and beverage facilities that deliver the level of quality and variety that sophisticated customers expect. We collaborate with our clients and all airport stakeholders—passengers, airlines, authorities having jurisdiction, tenants, and the local community—whether we’re designing a renovation, expansion, or new terminal building. And when it’s time to build, we know how to plan the work for the least possible disruption to airport operations. We can’t control missed connections or weather delays, but when your passengers are “stuck at the airport,” we do all we can to make sure they don’t feel that way.<br>

                            Which is why it takes such specialized engineering skill to ensure each take off occurs without incident. At Stantec, we work hard to keep every leg of the passenger journey safe and efficient. We design runways, taxiways, and aprons; lighting and navigational aids; and refueling systems; and perform safety area studies and upgrades; utility engineering, and pavement management studies with the passenger first and foremost in our minds. We’re always looking for improved ways of doing things. As part of our spearheading of research and development to study the potential benefits of using Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) on airport construction projects, we recently prepared a special study at Logan International Airport on the environmental benefits and construction efficiencies of using WMA pavements. Keeping airports open and safe during these projects is essential, and we create logical and realistic phasing plans that reduce impacts to airport operations, all while making safety a priority.<br>

                            Healthcare is a risky business. When expanding or renovating your buildings, speed and cost control is the name of the game. Stantec has successfully deployed a variety of strategies for project delivery: CM at risk, design-build, Integrated Project Delivery (IPD), and design/build/finance/operate. Combined with our use of Building Information Modeling (BIM), our IPD experience has demonstrated significant improvements in construction and design outcomes. We apply many of the beneficial IPD principles to each of the delivery systems including collaborative decision-making, early involvement of key participants, intensified early planning, open and enhanced communication, and jointly developed and validated targets. We think nobody has done more Public-Private Partnerships (P3) or alternative-finance procurements in healthcare than we have. Our P3 and private finance initiative healthcare experience includes $7 billion in construction as an owner’s advisor and $3 billion in construction as the proponent’s designer across Canada, US, UK, and Australia.<br>

                            And we’re always thinking of ways to make that trip more efficient, more accurate, and safer. From conveyor design restraints to sorting and screening requirements, from coordination with existing building systems to accommodating future terminal system expansion, we’ve met the challenges that make baggage system design so specialized. We use that understanding to create solutions that meet the financial, functional, and operational goals of airport designers, operators, airlines, and other stakeholders. Feasibility studies. Structural analysis. Simulation modeling. We use the most effective tools to incorporate the design of baggage systems seamlessly into the early planning stages of an airport terminal project; this means baggage system design is integrated into every design decision. So relax. We’ve got baggage.<br>

                            We see the opportunity through BIM to effectively engage the client, project team, and stakeholders and to produce better coordinated and integrated design solutions. It’s the key to unlocking your building’s potential. Using this powerful technology, we can help you move your project forward, improve your operations, and capitalize on opportunities. BIM can influence how designers, builders, and owners approach collaboration, processes, information exchange, technology, and design. The power of BIM is the ability to link parametric data to virtual 3D objects. To take full advantage of this technology, one should think of it as a collection of data that defines a project. Leveraging this data (the “I” in BIM) is the key to optimizing the benefits of BIM.<br>

                            We create communities by planning, developing, designing, and implementing the infrastructure needed to sustain their growth. Designing these components is best described as controlling the horizontal and vertical features of the infrastructure you see at ground level, and the infrastructure you can’t see underground. Our civil engineers are involved in specifying and designing streets, sidewalks, water supply networks, sewers, municipal solid waste management and disposal, and stormwater management. Although standards and best practices provide guidance for the design of civil infrastructure, each project has its own unique challenges. Each site is different, and the restrictions can range from vertical terrain issues to a lack of existing infrastructure for new development. We analyze every project and recommend the best approach for completing a competent design that also makes sense. Watch us dig in to find new techniques and software programs, and loop in our extensive resource pool to tackle the issues. Some call it drive, but the bottom line is we’re open to new ideas and techniques that will help provide you with optimal results.<br>

                            For existing buildings, our in-house evaluation is used to reveal how much energy a facility is currently consuming then identifies ways to reduce energy and water usage. We establish realistic reduction targets, along with a host of conservation strategies. Working together, we’ll evaluate each strategy against your building’s unique circumstances to select the most reasonable options. This includes recommendations for improvements, probable costs, and plans for ongoing rate monitoring. For new buildings, we use energy modeling to predict consumption levels. Together, we’ll establish reduction goals and apply methods to conserve energy facility wide. Our customized modeling considers the operations at individual plants. Interestingly, two facilities owned by the same company may have differing procedures. We recognize that fact. Every energy model we develop is custom to your specific facility and process. Often the largest potential savings is in the process equipment and operation. We leverage years of process experience to optimize the potential in your process. We understand the energy related issues in the built environment. Our customized audits, energy engineering, commissioning, and analyses can help your facility personnel to operate the building with optimum efficiency, and in turn realize significant operational savings.<br>

                            We share your value that the safety of employees, customers, visitors, and the community at large is a crucial element in the design of science and technology facilities. Value motivates us every day as we develop appropriate measures to manage the hazardous materials that are used in your labs and manufacturing facilities. While the proper use and storage of hazardous materials is required by building codes for laboratory, science, and biopharmaceutical facilities, we know that hazardous material management is the right thing to do, a critical safety consideration within science and technology buildings. Intrinsic to planning and design, the safe use and storage of hazardous materials is expected, and we deliver on that expectation through our extensive knowledge and experience with building codes and standards, with building construction, with integrated design of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, and with creative problem solving. We are driven not only by your values but also by our own core values, the first of which is building long-standing relationships with our clients by communicating openly and viewing each project as a unique entity. <br>

                            When mechanical engineers work with architects right from the start to incorporate mechanical systems into the design of highly complex research and science buildings, that’s integrated design. This approach to science and technology design benefits everyone, from our clients, to the community of users, to every one of us who has or will ever need a cutting-edge medical treatment or cure. That’s a tall order, but it is indeed at the very heart of our integrated design services, particularly for facilities in which highly controlled heating and ventilation, flexibility, and energy efficiency are critical. Integrating complex mechanical systems with architectural elements in the initial building design not only saves energy, costs and space, but also creates a more organized, better functioning system so that critical research and information is not lost, even in emergencies. Building strong partnerships is as important as building state-of-the-art mechanical systems. The trust and collaboration that those relationships require are what help us address the challenges of our work in these unique buildings. <br>

                            That’s why the infrastructure surrounding an airport – the roadways, parking lots and garages, walkways, and hangars – and the infrastructure underneath the airport (utilities and drainage) are so important. They’re often the first thing your passengers experience, and we want that first impression to be positive and lasting. We make it easier to start the journey. We’ve developed bypasses and roundabouts, urban connectors and intersection upgrades for many primary, secondary, and local roadways along with upgraded access for numerous airports. No one’s getting lost on our watch. And we look at the whole site, completing engineering analyses to identify existing on-site and off-site utilities. The potential for system upgrades to meet current and future project demands. Efficient utility corridors. We give the same scrutiny to parking facilities, creating spaces that welcome passengers, make them feel secure as they leave their vehicles to begin the next phase of their journey. We understand the need to create a seamless travel experience from landside to airside and, safely home again. <br>

                            To appreciate the importance of light, it’s important to understand why and how people use a space. We design architectural lighting solutions for projects ranging from urban streets to high-end retail, signature performing arts centers to world-class museums and beyond. In every project, light is located with care, using human perception as our guide. With light, we create safer, more appealing spaces that fulfill functional needs and go further, giving life, vitality and spirit to neighborhoods and communal gathering spots. Deeply committed to sustainable solutions – energy-conscious planning, daylighting and preserving the nighttime sky are just a few of our strategies to improve resource use while demonstrating greater respect for the environment. <br>

                            You get to see a variety of routes before you have to commit to any one in particular, and you might even find roadways that you didn’t know existed, opening up new opportunities and enhancing your trip. When clients recognize the need for new, expanded or upgraded facilities involving either renovations or new construction, but need help envisioning exactly how to proceed, we listen very carefully and develop a master plan to assist in realizing goals. Depending on what we learn from you, as well as from your users, we develop a customized master plan. Additionally, with our technical expertise in master planning and a thorough understanding of relevant codes, regulations, engineering, and environmentally responsible requirements, we can help you to envision a wide range of possibilities. Understanding is crucial to a successful master plan. We know that deciding which alternate is best often involves more than costs and schedules. To assist you in this regard, we develop a decision making matrix that identifies the project attributes that best describe a successful project. <br>

                            To address anything from plans for large installation-wide populations of over 30,000 persons down to small specialized facility plans. We have traveled across the United States, Asia, and the Middle East to support Department of Defense missions. Our master planning and programming projects for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command have taken us from coast to coast. With more than 40 years of combined experience in all aspects of Military Planning and Programming, we have the capacity and resources to complete projects of varying size and scope. We have developed master plans for remote expeditionary facilities to serve deployed U.S. Air Force contingency operations. We provided Master plans for the Department of Defense Educational Activity (DoDEA) to serve the families of warfighters in their home communities throughout the eastern U.S. and the Caribbean region. Our Net Zero Energy Installation Plans for U.S. Army Garrisons at Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels, Germany are on the leading edge of the effort to improve energy security at all installations worldwide.<br>

                            We create the mathematical model of the manufacturing process and use that model to simulate the process over a range of scenarios, allowing accurate forecasting of the effects of design decisions. In this way, we can optimize designs, de-bottleneck the process, and evaluate the impact of throughput changes or process modifications. Better still, our clients not only gain a fuller understanding of their process and project, but also avoid the unintended consequences that often result from seemingly innocuous issues. Because we are process designers, we understand process design issues. The hardest part of this effort is tech transfer – getting full disclosure of what is going on in the process. To overcome this challenge, we use an extensive set of tools to collect process information from owners, and we conduct interactive model review sessions to validate the model against reality. The creation of the model is not the end goal – an optimized design is. <br>

                            Extreme weather events like Katrina, Irene, Sandy, and the Alberta floods—plus droughts, economic downturns, infrastructure decay, aging populations, hackers, earthquakes, terrorism, and more—draw our attention to a growing movement in architecture and engineering: resilience. So what do we talk about when we talk about resilience? We believe resilience is the capacity of people, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems to endure, adapt, and thrive regardless of chronic stresses and acute shocks that occur. Stantec’s work—professional consulting in disaster response and recovery, resilience assessment, mitigation, and design—unites infrastructure, environmental, and quality of life improvements to advance community resilience across the globe. We deploy emerging approaches such as the planning and assessment tool Envision to help our communities evaluate, measure, and track progress towards resiliency.<br>

                            Whether a new development or renewal, we provide consulting services at every scale of the built, natural and organizational environments. Whether you are interested in LEED®, Green Globes, BREEAM or you’re just interested in becoming more sustainable, we have a team of experts ready to advise and guide you through the process. We’re thinking about how to leverage alternate energy systems design, building performance analysis, daylighting strategies, energy audits, efficient lighting systems design, energy performance and modeling, green roofs, grey and black water systems, indoor environmental assessments, life cycle costing, natural ventilation design, photovoltaics, solar and wind energy, to change our future. Why? Because if the building stock in North America were upgraded to achieve a 20% reduction in potable water consumption we could save 3 trillion gallons of water, because if we all used mugs or glasses versus paper cups we could save more than 52 million trees annually, because 1,265 lives could be saved each year if a 20% increase in daylighting in hospitals resulted in just a 1% reduction in medical errors. We’re making a difference, one project at a time – for ours and future generations. <br>

                            Technology is the invisible thread that connects each of us to the world around us. It brings efficiency to our infrastructure and buildings, to our processes and increasingly shapes the way we experience the world. Information and communications technology (ICT) integrates telecommunications, intelligent building management systems, security and audio-visual systems. Though you may not see it, every building that you step into employs ICT through security and fire alarm management, audio and video processing, transmission and network based control, even the telephone and internet. Why is ICT important? Smarter buildings can operate more efficiently, improve operational efficiency and provide the enabled environments which fuels discovery and innovation. Increasingly it is technology that connects us to each other and to the broader world around us. It is changing the way we do business, receive care, teach, learn and travel from A to B. What does the future hold? We believe, it has unlimited possibility - with smarter buildings and infrastructure to connect us, raise awareness and transform business operations. Let us show you how.<br>

                            Through design visualization, clients and stakeholders can picture the building they’ll work in, the bridge they’ll drive over, the neighborhood their kids will play in, and the campus that becomes a home away from home. Changes to design can be seen and understood immediately. When the project stakeholders can envision the end result of the design work, community excitement and project support builds. With our in-house team of filmmakers, animators, 3D modelers, and application engineers, we can produce a range of products, from cinematic photorealistic films and building renderings, to data-driven facility fly-throughs. These tools help clients, stakeholders, and others involved in the process to quickly gain an understanding of the design direction, upon which solid solutions can be built. <br>

                            On, above, and below the earth’s surface – we provide surveying and mapping to define land boundaries, earth’s physical features, and the built environment. Armed with tools like GPS, GIS, 3D laser scanners, and aerial photogrammetry, we deliver innovative solutions for remote and challenging environments or complex urban settings. Our projects are as broad as the places we work including residential, industrial, highway, rail, aviation, utility and power, environmental, oil and gas, federal, and institutional. Geomatics is the science of collection, analysis, display, and management of spatial information. The art is interpreting this information for legal matters of land definition or to support mapping, design, or construction activities. Addressing unique logistical and technical aspects of each project, our experts offer services that include boundary and cadastral surveys, topographic mapping, construction staking, residential builder layout, ALTA/ACSM surveys, 3D laser scanning, geodetic and control surveys, route surveys, as-built surveys, aerial photogrammetric mapping, water rights surveys, hydrographic/bathometric mapping, and subsurface utility engineering.<br>

                            Landscape Architecture combines beauty and function with sustainability. At Stantec, we create inspired landscapes that reflect context and user needs. Through analysis, planning, and design, we create sustainable environments that are functional, innovative, and attractive. Whether it’s wayfinding at a college campus, a healing garden on a hospital’s green roof, a monument in an urban park, or an athletic complex, our landscape architects make valuable contributions to the quality of life in our communities. Our range of projects is broad - including neighborhood and community design, urban design, park and recreation planning and design, resort design, landscape reclamation and restoration, heritage conservation, as well as landscape assessments and development plans. We are helping our clients achieve their unique project goals for the design, organization, and use of spaces. From concept and design development through to construction drawings and contract administration, we generate creative ideas that are economically viable and environmentally responsive. <br>

                            Change often comes with stress and uncertainty. Our public participation specialists work with our clients to develop and implement communication and consultation plans that allow people affected by change to understand, influence, and accept it. When a new development is planned or new building built, the community wants to know how it will affect traffic, the environment, and their daily lives. When a new park is planned, users want to be involved to create a space that meets their needs. By being involved from the conceptual stage of a project, we raise awareness and understanding of the project’s impact, define and manage expectations, and build trusting relationships between those impacted by the project and those building it. We use traditional and non-traditional methods from public meetings, focus groups, and open houses to web surveys and social media to share information and ensure all affected groups have a say in a forum that works for them. In doing so, views and concerns can be expressed to inform decision-making and build consensus. The result is a project that is viable and more likely to be accepted by a community that feels like it had a voice.<br>

                            Urban design represents a unique way of looking at the towns and cities where we work: In the midst of economic and social change, we identify opportunities to improve livability, expand economic opportunity and equity, and promote environmental responsibility. We help our clients clarify values and craft visions both achievable and compelling. Our plans and designs advance community visions beautifully—whether for a Main Street, a neighborhood, or an entire downtown—but they also pay off in other ways. When Transit Oriented Developments lift real estate values, a community gains jobs and new revenues that can underwrite more affordable housing. When Complete Streets invite people to leave their car at home and walk, bike or use transit, then public health gets a boost and our carbon footprint shrinks. When imaginative design turns a brownfield into a leafy riverbank park, or a seawall into an elegant esplanade, quality of life rises and environmental threats recede. Our urban design team creates spaces, networks and infrastructure that connect people to each other and equip communities to thrive socially, economically and environmentally.<br>

                            We transform land into real projects – a fit between physical site conditions, public expectations, fiscal requirements, and environmental constraints. From residential and commercial developments to industrial, recreational, resort, and institutional projects, our experience is broad. Our site and infrastructure solutions are key to the financial viability of a project and innovative infrastructure and stormwater management solutions not only form the framework for the site, they help define the final design. Using technology to enhance our design and implementation skills, we save our clients money and increase their return on investment. Whether for a new phase, new neighbourhood, or new city, we offer services that add value to a project including infrastructure design, construction observation, contract administration, land and earthworks analysis, stormwater management, and studies for feasibility, servicing, drainage, property development potential. Creating solutions that are environmentally responsible, functional, and technically sound, we are shaping the landscape of our communities. <br>

                            Tree-ring analysis (dendrochronology) can be interpreted alongside historical documents with surprising accuracy. Suddenly it’s not abandoned anymore, but a home with a history that can be recorded and preserved. Heritage resources include precontact, historic, and palaeontological sites, which are protected under provincial/state, territorial, and federal legislation. During one archaeological assessment we looked at over 5,000 artifacts and two structures from 2,500 to 3,000 years ago. We practice respectful collection and interpretation of information and share past and present cultural diversity with future generations. Studying the predecessors of today’s animals is equally as informative. A toothed whale (odontecetes) might be from the early Miocene Epoch, but we can easily imagine what it looked like. Without paleontology though, we could never envision a Tyrannosaurus Rex. In reality, we wouldn’t even know he existed. Bone, half a metre in length, can lie buried underneath your feet for thousands of years, without notice. Stantec is working with developers to ensure that we can build new and preserve old.<br>

                            When we work with you to prepare permit applications and environmental assessments, the primary goal is to obtain sufficient information to meet regulatory requirements. We provide permitting strategy, environmental assessment and application preparation, and technical support for projects requiring municipal, provincial/state and federal environmental approvals and licenses. We have excellent working relationships with regulatory agencies throughout North America and these relationships help us to create an effective approach to securing regulatory approvals. Early identification of constraints, client goals, regulatory agency needs, and stakeholder issues allows us to address problems before they can knock a project off course. Solid, defensible applications need data to back them up. Stantec has the in-house expertise and experience in collecting and analyzing data on the atmospheric, aquatic, terrestrial, and socioeconomic environments for input to environmental assessments and regulatory applications. From there, we can design management and monitoring programs for the life of a project.<br>

                            Impact assessments look more deeply at the effects on human receptors. Specialists model and measure releases into the atmosphere using approved techniques from federal and state/provincial guidelines. By modeling worst and alternate case scenarios for you, we can help create an overall risk communication plan. Specifically, dispersion and odour models factor in emissions, weather data, and terrain profiles to develop management strategies for air quality. Indoor air quality investigations address nuisance odours, mold, and unexplained illnesses from occupants. Acoustical/noise analysis helps uncover the best noise control options by reviewing source and terrain conditions. Renderings and baseline light measurements help determine facility lighting that is more efficient, and less visible. Across energy and resource, infrastructure, and building sectors, atmospheric analyses assist in establishing optimal operating conditions for facilities experiencing atmospheric releases. <br>

                            Our aquatic and wildlife biologists, plant ecologists, engineers, hydrologists, geomorphologists, and other specialists aren’t afraid to look outside the norm to address the impairments in a way that builds on the strengths of the unique environment. Working with provincial/state and federal agencies, restoring ecosystem functionality is our goal when we examine the leftover parts of a disturbed natural system and decide how it should fit back together. We have leading experts in all types of ecosystems, ranging from coastal systems to rivers and lakes; prairies to uplands and forests; and boreal forests to alpine and arctic environments. In the energy and resources sectors, reclamation of large scale disturbances is a critical component of life-cycle management. We can help you design for closure in tandem with your development and operation activities, keeping in mind traditional use and traditional knowledge. We make it our mission to understand the purpose and to tailor our design, whether it’s a dam removal, river restoration, or site reclamation. <br>

                            Covering everything from screening level to comprehensive risk assessments, we help you develop site-specific criteria for the management of potential health concerns. When chemical concentrations exceed standards set by provincial/state/federal authorities, decisions have to be made. The presence of a chemical in excess of a guideline doesn’t mean that adverse effects to health will occur, but does suggest further evaluation. At sites where cleanup to generic criteria levels would be costly, we provide the technical resources to develop site-specific criteria instead. By reassessing the assumptions used in the generic criteria or generating site-specific toxicological data we can create custom clean-up levels. For sites with ecological risk we use in-house terrestrial toxicology laboratories to seamlessly incorporate bioassessibility and terrestrial toxicity testing. The underlying health risk assessment principles for planned projects are very similar to contaminated sites and look at exposure to contaminants in soil, sediment, water, air, and food.<br>

                            We go beyond “working” with the mining industry. We share our perspectives, values, and knowledge, and in the process, create a community behind a project. We are biologists, geologists, archeologists, hydrologists, engineers, geochemists, regulatory experts, risk assessors, and toxicologists. Our roles may differ, but together we share the land and the resources we mine. Our experience allows us to think of creative solutions for addressing regulatory, environmental, and community challenges in gold, silver, nickel, copper, zinc, coal, platinum, aggregate, diamonds, uranium, or potash mining operations. At all stages—exploration, planning, operations, closure—we work to keep your projects moving forward safely, and ensure the natural environment is preserved for generations to come. <br>

                            We’ve been providing field services for more than 15 years, with an experienced team who specializes in this type of work. So we know that lack of reliable and accessible engineering information for operating assets can decrease your ability to optimize or manage risk. Our team provides detailed field verification (as-building), critical drawing maintenance programs, metering and measurement. Detailed as-built drawings ensure that proper Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) reviews, site integrity reviews, future engineering designs as well as management of change (MOC) occurs on the most current version of critical engineering documentation. A drawing maintenance program will ensure that drawings are maintained and your initial project investment is protected. <br>

                            We look at how flow and volume in oceans, rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands can be impacted during project construction or operation and how it might affect growth, reproduction, bioenergetics, or survival of aquatic communities. By documenting existing conditions and determining potential impacts we develop avoidance and mitigation measures that are cost-effective but ensure protection of fish, aquatic invertebrates, and vegetation. Projects can also affect water quality. Our scientists, biologists, and technical staff use analytical chemistry and their toxicological expertise to study effects of organic and inorganic contaminants and emerging chemicals of concern. We maintain our own labs for taxonomic identification and sample processing of invertebrates and collaborate with academic partners to find new ways to measure and protect water quality. Based on our experience with power, transportation, mining, oil &amp; gas, and federal/state/provincial work, we help you create viable projects that show how development and nature can coexist.<br>

                            Whether through a Web portal or a geographic information system (GIS), we take data from multiple sources, work on it in layers, and create something unique to your requirements. With surprising speed, the numbers turn into maps that can represent key water crossings or setbacks, place species habitat concerns, and show property lines. Bringing all possible constraints to one place gets a discussion going. And because it’s virtual, we can change parameters to find the right project layout. 3-D models will help you experience the site, before and after. We design secure Web portals or custom databases to collect, manage, and help you use information to make business decisions. Today, you need effective IM solutions to meet government guidelines. A needs assessment captures the vision of how technology can support your core objectives without reinventing process or spending a lot of money. So whether it’s tracking public consultation comments, monitoring compliance, or designing an interactive map for land parcels, our conveyor belt will smooth out the production process.<br>

                            As projects in energy and resource, building, and infrastructure sectors move into closer proximity with existing developments and land-uses, public concerns are likely to increase. Taking time to learn more about our shared history builds stronger connections with our communities. By partnering with Aboriginal community members when we’re tracking wildlife or monitoring vegetation for an assessment, we open a window into traditional knowledge. Our field crews learn to identify plants with traditional uses and see places of cultural significance. And socio-economic specialists work with local residents to ensure communities are not only undamaged, but benefit in sustainable ways. When we feel connected as a community, we work better together.<br>

                            Our site investigation and instrumentation services are extensive and at the forefront of the industry. We are continuously evaluating new site investigation technology along with time-tested, proven methods. By combining these methods we’re confident in our designs and analyses. Whether you want to remotely keep an eye on the water levels in a high hazard dam embankment or ensure your new home is situated on stable ground, our engineers have the experience for this and everything in between. Our field inspectors and engineers are highly experienced in observing auger drilling, mud rotary, rock coring and many types of sampling. We understand the complex downhole situations that occur during the drilling process and can manage site investigations with multiple crews and challenging site conditions. We train our staff to work safely and to identify and correct safety concerns before they turn into incidents. Our end goal is to ensure site conditions are well understood and capture the necessary detail for engineering analyses that follow.<br>

                            Planning is problem solving. It starts with a vision to improve our communities balanced with a promise to treat our land responsibly. To create careful and thoughtful options for right now as well as for the future, we take into account site conditions, public input, client needs, and project requirements. Through a collaborative process, we listen to the ideas of the community members and the goals of the stakeholders to provide creative solutions for our most precious and limited commodity — land. We facilitate positive outcomes that satisfy the needs of clients and approval agencies alike. It’s about understanding the value of process, successful conflict resolution, collaboration and consensus building among all key stakeholders, while never losing sight of the goal to safeguard our natural resources. Because we live in the communities we serve, we feel strongly about responsible land planning. Our goal is to enhance the welfare of people and their communities by creating convenient, equitable, healthful, efficient, and attractive environments for present and future generations. <br>

                            We can do this because our team members have been in the industry for years. We’ve worked hard to earn the respect and trust of clients like Kinder Morgan, Caiman, Enbridge, Chesapeake, and Boardwalk Field Services. When we design a pipeline route, we take into account the environmental considerations, regulatory requirements, and your project goals before we hit the field. We know your project is on a tight schedule and budget, so the less time we can spend rerouting, the closer you get to a completed project. Our team will produce all the documents you need to get your pipeline in the ground and operating – construction alignment sheets, permit drawings, easement plats and engineering design drawings. Once you start construction, we’ll be there to ensure it gets built right. We’ll manage the construction activities, prepare the as-built survey, and the final as-built drawings. We take the best route, combining industry expertise with local knowledge to get it done right the first time. <br>

                            A teenager riding his bike over a major roadway by way of a multi-use path and pedestrian bridge. A man taking the train to visit his grandchildren. Different people, but with a shared goal: to get from Point A to Point B as quickly and safely as possible. We create the connections that get people and goods from here to there – whether by car, bus, train, plane, or their own two feet. Working within the context of the communities we serve, we provide planning, engineering, and infrastructure management services that fit the needs of our clients and improve the overall traveler experience. From major expressway and rural roadway projects to bridge rehabilitations, transit systems, and airport design, our focus is always on providing solutions that respect the local environment. And for us, simply engineering the various components of a transportation network doesn’t equal success. We also need to meet the needs of the people traveling every day. Because Stantec isn’t just a company; we’re people, with the same goals as everyone else – to get where we’re going, safely and efficiently.<br>

                            The need for geotechnical services is everywhere, so we work in a variety of sectors across North America for new commercial and institutional sites, transportation facilities, flood control structures, mining developments, near shore and offshore structures, renewable energy developments, utility expansions, and water storage projects. Our services include traditional geotechnical applications, such as settlement, slope stability, seepage analyses, and foundation and retaining wall design. But what sets Stantec apart is the value-added services we provide in numerical modeling, deep foundation evaluations, seismic engineering, risk-based engineering and associated economic analyses, and other related design services. To us, succeeding means providing creative solutions to the people we work with, on schedule and within budget. We stay at the forefront of the industry to make sure your community improvements are built on solid ground.<br>

                            Whether it comes to numerical modeling, seepage and stability analyses, design of machine foundations or nearly any other type of engineering analyses, we have professional staff that can help. We’re skilled at helping our clients understand soil-structure interaction. We focus on the interaction of soil and rock with structures, whether it’s supporting a residence on spread foundations, a heavily-loaded structure on deep foundations, or a dam or levee on native soils and bedrock. Our geotechnical and civil engineers interpret the findings of site investigations and laboratory testing as a basis to analyze and quantify the interaction of a proposed structure with the ground. In support of these analyses, we frequently utilize computer software to assess multiple modes of soil-structure interaction under design load cases relevant to the structure’s performance. <br>

                            How safe is the ground beneath your feet? Geohazards are geological conditions that may lead to localized or widespread damage to property and threaten personal safety. From immediate hazards to longer-term risks, our geotechnical specialists assess risk factors and manage threats from landslides, earthquakes and seismicity, rock falls, slope instability, shallow gas accumulation, sink holes, ground subsidence and erosive forces. We work with clients to protect infrastructure such as roadways, homes, sewers and pipelines, as well as natural environments such as wetlands, valley systems and beaches. We use detailed field reconnaissance, intrusive site investigation and instrumentation together with geophysical and remote sensing techniques to identify hazards. We assess these risks using local experience and sophisticated modeling, partnered with our team focus on effective listening and open communication. <br>

                            Even with sound engineering design and construction practice, changing ground conditions can negatively impact a project. Buildings settle or heave, basements leak, slopes fail, buried pipes break or collapse, walls crack, and sink holes appear. That’s where we come in. Our geotechnical team analyzes distresses and failures related, in whole or in part, to ground conditions. We carefully examine technical aspects of the project, the location and surrounding infrastructure. We’ll explore the history of the project, engineering design, construction methodologies and procedures, and operation and maintenance practices. Understanding the rules that direct design and construction and the contractual responsibilities among involved parties is a critical part of our work. Based on our analyses, we can determine causes of problems and define and assign appropriate level of legal responsibility. We regularly consult with experts and regulatory authorities, review contract documents and specifications, consult with and advise counsel in advance of legal proceedings, and provide expert witness and testimony in court. <br>
