        <br>            Moveable makes it easy! <br><br>Moveable was founded in 1983 and has grown steadily since then, <br>establishing a reputation for professionalism, thoughtful <br>attention to detail and a strong commitment to serving its <br>clients. Today the company operates around the clock out of a <br>landmark 21,000-square-foot loft space in Torontos downtown <br>west district, and employs 55 people. <br><br>Its prepress and scanning divisions offer a full range of <br>services, including conventional drum scans, Photo CD scans, <br>colour editing and image retouching, trapping, imposition and <br>film separations, and a variety of digital and analog proofing <br>options. Recent projects include advertising for Smirnoff and <br>Eli Lilly, sales material for Manulife Financial, magazine <br>spreads for Wedding Bells and Outpost, point-of-sale promotions <br>for Revlon and Yves St-Laurent, CD packaging for BMG Music, book <br>covers for Random House, Harcourt Canada and Key Porter, <br>catalogues for the Toronto International Film Festival and <br>Umbra, and annual reports for Bank of Montreal, Andres Wines, <br>Hydro One and Imax. <br><br>The companys digital printing division features a Heidelberg <br>Quickmaster DI press, two Xerox DocuColors, a DocuPrint black-<br>and-white printer and an in-house bindery.

                            WebCell is an online corporate sales and ordering system. With <br>
WebCell a cellular dealer/carrier can service more corporate <br>
accounts, more efficiently, and in a more organized way. <br>
<br>
WebCell has been designed to simplify the process of selling <br>
service plans, hardware, accessories and wireless devices to <br>
corporate clients. <br>
<br>
By using the Internet with a simple web browser (like the one <br>
you are using right now), corporate clients can review hardware, <br>
access plan information and place orders with pricing specific <br>
to their company, which removes many of the routine <br>
responsibilities that take up the time of corporate sales <br>
representatives. Representatives have more time to focus on <br>
sales, and corporate clients are satisfied that their orders and <br>
questions are dealt with immediately.<br>

                            WebStore is a complete online retailing solution that empowers <br>
small and medium sized businesses with the ability to set up <br>
hundreds, even thousands of sites on the internet that all <br>
process orders into one central order management system.<br>
<br>
WebStore has enabled one US based retailer to sell over 1.3 <br>
million in sales in one year without spending any money on <br>
marketing.<br>
<br>
Examples of WebStore can be viewed at <br>

The most amazing part of WebStore is the price, only $15k CAD <br>
and a very small transaction fee, and is hosted for only <br>

                            Moveable Online offers advanced Web services, including custom <br>
application development and hosting. Our primary role is to <br>
support  not compete with  a graphic design team, allowing <br>
designers to offer the back-end technical expertise of an <br>
experienced development team along with their design, branding <br>
and communications services.<br>
<br>
Our staff includes talented web-application programmers, Flash <br>
artists, information architects, database developers and project <br>
managers, all headed up by an experienced IT management team. <br>
<br>
Moveables hosting facility is state-of-the-art. Twelve Compaq <br>
enterprise-class Web/application/database servers sit within our <br>
clustered server farm in a secure, climate controlled <br>
environment. Our Internet connection is a massive OC12 fibre-<br>
optic pipe, with an OC3 back-up. The network is fully redundant <br>
and fully switched, and features multiple stages of UPS back-up <br>
to ensure maximum uptime. <br>
 <br>
We offer complex application hosting for the following <br>
programming environments: Java(J2EE), ASP, Cold Fusion, <br>
Witango2000 and PHP. We house a clustered, enterprise edition MS <br>
SQL Server 2000.<br>
<br>
We have focused our expertise on areas in which we can offer <br>
complex logic solutions that simplify the experience of the end <br>
user. Our skills lie primarily in database-driven dynamic <br>
application development coupled with solid HTML coding.<br>

                            Once upon a time digital printing meant so-so quality for short-<br>
runs  useful when you had no other choice. No longer. Moveable <br>
Print sets the bar very high indeed. Now you dont have to <br>
settle for low-grade reproduction when you need full-colour <br>
printing in small quantities (and with the addition of our <br>
Heidelberg DI, those quantities are no longer so small!). <br>
<br>
Our Xerox DocuColor 2045s deliver superior quality and <br>
versatility  dazzling solids with no banding, and sharp, <br>
colourful reproduction  all on stock as heavy as 12 pt. They <br>
handle variable data too, for personalized, targeted promotions, <br>
and are the ideal solution for print runs of 1 to 1,000.<br>
<br>
For longer print runs, our Heidelberg Quickmaster DI takes over. <br>
The DI is an automated direct-to-plate offset press that <br>
eliminates the need for film, and enables us to offer fast <br>
turnarounds at competitive rates. While our DocuColors continue <br>
to be the right choice for short runs, the DI is ideally suited <br>
for longer runs of 1,000 to 5,000. <br>
<br>
Added to this mix, is a complete in-house bindery to ensure that <br>
we can meet even the most challenging deadlines.<br>
<br>
But we offer much more than an impressive array of equipment. We <br>
also have the talent to get the most out of the hardware, and to <br>
ensure that we exceed your expectations on every job. We can <br>
help you choose the best printing and finishing options and find <br>
cost-effective short-cuts. Sometimes that can point to a <br>
conventional printing solution. In these cases our experienced <br>
print consultants can tap into our large network of trade <br>
printer associates, and manage your project for you. <br>
 <br>
Whichever route we take, well assume complete responsibility <br>
for the finished product, and we will always bend over backwards <br>
to solve problems and meet tough deadlines. Thats been the <br>
Moveable way for more than 18 years.<br>

                            Despite technological advancements over the past few years, <br>
providing reliable prepress services still requires experience <br>
and intelligence. We have lots of great hardware and software, <br>
but we dont let the equipment do the thinking for us. Our <br>
superior track record comes from our superior staff, who delve <br>
into every file to take charge of trapping, imposition and <br>
preflighting. Thats how we are able to avoid the common <br>
problems that continue to plague the prepress process, like text <br>
reflows, font substitutions, inaccurate trapping and colour <br>
shifts. <br>
<br>
<br>
Our process has been honed to perfection. Add to that lots of <br>
capacity and 24-hour-a-day production, and its no wonder that <br>
we routinely outperform other prepress houses. Our turnarounds <br>
are legendary: five- and six-colour annual reports trapped, <br>
imposed, run to film and proofed overnight.<br>

                            There is more to printing a digital poster than hitting a few <br>
keys. The success of your project will hinge on the degree of <br>
care, expertise, and project management skill of your supplier. <br>
At Moveable we pride ourselves on adding value to every job in <br>
so many ways. <br>
<br>
<br>
For example, our estimators do much more than just provide <br>
quotations. They will also ask the right questions and help you <br>
find the best and most cost-effective solution for each job. <br>
This may include advice on substrates, choice of imaging device <br>
and finishing options. They will also walk you through file <br>
preparation requirements, like optimum resolution of images and <br>
file formats. And they will give you realistic turnaround times <br>
(realistic for us, impossible for most of our competitors!), and <br>
then act as project managers to ensure that those commitments <br>
are met. <br>
<br>
<br>
Our production team  which spans three shifts  is the best in <br>
the business. Their focus on quality control and fast <br>
turnarounds continues to garner glowing testimonials from our <br>
clients. They are on top of every job, from preflighting to <br>
colour matching to inspecting every output to ensure that it <br>
meets our standards before going out the door. <br>
<br>
<br>
We currently offer both thermal and piezo-electric inkjets. <br>
Thermal inkjet posters offer brilliant, saturated colour for <br>
indoor and short-term outdoor applications. They are ideal for <br>
short print runs where high impact colour is the top priority. <br>
Because they use water-soluble dyes, thermal inkjet posters must <br>
be laminated to protect them from damage due to moisture. Piezo <br>
posters are less expensive than thermal inkjets and are ideal <br>
when longer print runs are required. The colour is not quite as <br>
vibrant as with thermal inkjets, but reproduction quality is <br>
excellent and the high-resolution option provides outstanding <br>
detail. They are durable and suitable for long-term outdoor <br>
applications.<br>
<br>
But we offer much more than an impressive array of equipment. We <br>
also have the talent to get the most out of the hardware, and to <br>
ensure that we exceed your expectations on every job. We can <br>
help you choose the best printing and finishing options and find <br>
cost-effective short-cuts. Sometimes that can point to a <br>
conventional printing solution. In these cases our experienced <br>
print consultants can tap into our large network of trade <br>
printer associates, and manage your project for you. <br>
 <br>
Whichever route we take, well assume complete responsibility <br>
for the finished product, and we will always bend over backwards <br>
to solve problems and meet tough deadlines. Thats been the <br>
Moveable way for more than 18 years.<br>

                            What makes our scanning services special?<br>
<br>
First and foremost, its our people. This division boasts four <br>
full-time drum scanner operators with some 45 years of <br>
collective experience in scanning, colour correction and <br>
retouching work. They have earned their stripes on a wide <br>
variety of high-end projects, including beautiful  and <br>
demanding  art catalogues, annual reports, print ads, brochures <br>
and point-of-purchase materials. <br>
<br>
<br>
Then there are the toys that help them do their jobs so well: a <br>
state-of-the art Linotype-Hell drum scanner; high-end calibrated <br>
monitors; 5000o K viewing booths at every workstation; a clean, <br>
lighting-controlled environment; and complete analogue and <br>
digital proofing facilities. It all adds up to scanning quality <br>
and colour work that is second-to-none, combined with our <br>
renowned, incredibly fast turnarounds. <br>
<br>
<br>
But theres more. Not all jobs call for drum scan quality. You <br>
may require digital images for a Web site. Or you may have a <br>
large library of transparencies that needs to be digitized. <br>
Perhaps you are putting together design presentations and would <br>
like some quick and dirty scans to serve as positionals. For <br>
these and other types of projects we offer cost-effective Photo <br>
CD and desktop scans. Our customer service representatives will <br>
be happy to discuss your projects and make appropriate <br>
recommendations. They will recommend the right solution for <br>
every job.<br>

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              FootballFanatics.com was the first client to use <br>
our e-commerce retail solution called WebStore. <br>
In their first full year and with only five <br>
employees FootballFanatics.com sold over <br>
$1,300,000.00, and did so while spending less <br>
than $100,000 on development and marketing! <br>
Entering into year two, FootballFanatics.com is <br>
already at 10X growth over last year.

                            WebCell is an online corporate sales and ordering system. With <br>
WebCell a cellular dealer/carrier can service more corporate <br>
accounts, more efficiently, and in a more organized way. <br>
<br>
WebCell has been designed to simplify the process of selling <br>
service plans, hardware, accessories and wireless devices to <br>
corporate clients. <br>
<br>
By using the Internet with a simple web browser (like the one <br>
you are using right now), corporate clients can review hardware, <br>
access plan information and place orders with pricing specific <br>
to their company, which removes many of the routine <br>
responsibilities that take up the time of corporate sales <br>
representatives. Representatives have more time to focus on <br>
sales, and corporate clients are satisfied that their orders and <br>
questions are dealt with immediately.<br>

                            Moveable Online offers advanced Web services, including custom <br>
application development and hosting. Our primary role is to <br>
support  not compete with  a graphic design team, allowing <br>
designers to offer the back-end technical expertise of an <br>
experienced development team along with their design, branding <br>
and communications services.<br>
<br>
Our staff includes talented web-application programmers, Flash <br>
artists, information architects, database developers and project <br>
managers, all headed up by an experienced IT management team. <br>
<br>
Moveables hosting facility is state-of-the-art. Twelve Compaq <br>
enterprise-class Web/application/database servers sit within our <br>
clustered server farm in a secure, climate controlled <br>
environment. Our Internet connection is a massive OC12 fibre-<br>
optic pipe, with an OC3 back-up. The network is fully redundant <br>
and fully switched, and features multiple stages of UPS back-up <br>
to ensure maximum uptime. <br>
 <br>
We offer complex application hosting for the following <br>
programming environments: Java(J2EE), ASP, Cold Fusion, <br>
Witango2000 and PHP. We house a clustered, enterprise edition MS <br>
SQL Server 2000.<br>
<br>
We have focused our expertise on areas in which we can offer <br>
complex logic solutions that simplify the experience of the end <br>
user. Our skills lie primarily in database-driven dynamic <br>
application development coupled with solid HTML coding.<br>

                            Once upon a time digital printing meant so-so quality for short-<br>
runs  useful when you had no other choice. No longer. Moveable <br>
Print sets the bar very high indeed. Now you dont have to <br>
settle for low-grade reproduction when you need full-colour <br>
printing in small quantities (and with the addition of our <br>
Heidelberg DI, those quantities are no longer so small!). <br>
<br>
Our Xerox DocuColor 2045s deliver superior quality and <br>
versatility  dazzling solids with no banding, and sharp, <br>
colourful reproduction  all on stock as heavy as 12 pt. They <br>
handle variable data too, for personalized, targeted promotions, <br>
and are the ideal solution for print runs of 1 to 1,000.<br>
<br>
For longer print runs, our Heidelberg Quickmaster DI takes over. <br>
The DI is an automated direct-to-plate offset press that <br>
eliminates the need for film, and enables us to offer fast <br>
turnarounds at competitive rates. While our DocuColors continue <br>
to be the right choice for short runs, the DI is ideally suited <br>
for longer runs of 1,000 to 5,000. <br>
<br>
Added to this mix, is a complete in-house bindery to ensure that <br>
we can meet even the most challenging deadlines.<br>
<br>
But we offer much more than an impressive array of equipment. We <br>
also have the talent to get the most out of the hardware, and to <br>
ensure that we exceed your expectations on every job. We can <br>
help you choose the best printing and finishing options and find <br>
cost-effective short-cuts. Sometimes that can point to a <br>
conventional printing solution. In these cases our experienced <br>
print consultants can tap into our large network of trade <br>
printer associates, and manage your project for you. <br>
 <br>
Whichever route we take, well assume complete responsibility <br>
for the finished product, and we will always bend over backwards <br>
to solve problems and meet tough deadlines. Thats been the <br>
Moveable way for more than 18 years.<br>

                            Despite technological advancements over the past few years, <br>
providing reliable prepress services still requires experience <br>
and intelligence. We have lots of great hardware and software, <br>
but we dont let the equipment do the thinking for us. Our <br>
superior track record comes from our superior staff, who delve <br>
into every file to take charge of trapping, imposition and <br>
preflighting. Thats how we are able to avoid the common <br>
problems that continue to plague the prepress process, like text <br>
reflows, font substitutions, inaccurate trapping and colour <br>
shifts. <br>
<br>
<br>
Our process has been honed to perfection. Add to that lots of <br>
capacity and 24-hour-a-day production, and its no wonder that <br>
we routinely outperform other prepress houses. Our turnarounds <br>
are legendary: five- and six-colour annual reports trapped, <br>

                            There is more to printing a digital poster than hitting a few <br>
keys. The success of your project will hinge on the degree of <br>
care, expertise, and project management skill of your supplier. <br>
At Moveable we pride ourselves on adding value to every job in <br>
so many ways. <br>
<br>
<br>
For example, our estimators do much more than just provide <br>
quotations. They will also ask the right questions and help you <br>
find the best and most cost-effective solution for each job. <br>
This may include advice on substrates, choice of imaging device <br>
and finishing options. They will also walk you through file <br>
preparation requirements, like optimum resolution of images and <br>
file formats. And they will give you realistic turnaround times <br>
(realistic for us, impossible for most of our competitors!), and <br>
then act as project managers to ensure that those commitments <br>
are met. <br>
<br>
<br>
Our production team  which spans three shifts  is the best in <br>
the business. Their focus on quality control and fast <br>
turnarounds continues to garner glowing testimonials from our <br>
clients. They are on top of every job, from preflighting to <br>
colour matching to inspecting every output to ensure that it <br>
meets our standards before going out the door. <br>
<br>
<br>
We currently offer both thermal and piezo-electric inkjets. <br>
Thermal inkjet posters offer brilliant, saturated colour for <br>
indoor and short-term outdoor applications. They are ideal for <br>
short print runs where high impact colour is the top priority. <br>
Because they use water-soluble dyes, thermal inkjet posters must <br>
be laminated to protect them from damage due to moisture. Piezo <br>
posters are less expensive than thermal inkjets and are ideal <br>
when longer print runs are required. The colour is not quite as <br>
vibrant as with thermal inkjets, but reproduction quality is <br>
excellent and the high-resolution option provides outstanding <br>
detail. They are durable and suitable for long-term outdoor <br>
applications.<br>
<br>
But we offer much more than an impressive array of equipment. We <br>
also have the talent to get the most out of the hardware, and to <br>
ensure that we exceed your expectations on every job. We can <br>
help you choose the best printing and finishing options and find <br>
cost-effective short-cuts. Sometimes that can point to a <br>
conventional printing solution. In these cases our experienced <br>
print consultants can tap into our large network of trade <br>
printer associates, and manage your project for you. <br>
 <br>
Whichever route we take, well assume complete responsibility <br>
for the finished product, and we will always bend over backwards <br>
to solve problems and meet tough deadlines. Thats been the <br>
Moveable way for more than 18 years.<br>

                            What makes our scanning services special?<br>
<br>
First and foremost, its our people. This division boasts four <br>
full-time drum scanner operators with some 45 years of <br>
collective experience in scanning, colour correction and <br>
retouching work. They have earned their stripes on a wide <br>
variety of high-end projects, including beautiful  and <br>
demanding  art catalogues, annual reports, print ads, brochures <br>
and point-of-purchase materials. <br>
<br>
<br>
Then there are the toys that help them do their jobs so well: a <br>
state-of-the art Linotype-Hell drum scanner; high-end calibrated <br>
monitors; 5000o K viewing booths at every workstation; a clean, <br>
lighting-controlled environment; and complete analogue and <br>
digital proofing facilities. It all adds up to scanning quality <br>
and colour work that is second-to-none, combined with our <br>
renowned, incredibly fast turnarounds. <br>
<br>
<br>
But theres more. Not all jobs call for drum scan quality. You <br>
may require digital images for a Web site. Or you may have a <br>
large library of transparencies that needs to be digitized. <br>
Perhaps you are putting together design presentations and would <br>
like some quick and dirty scans to serve as positionals. For <br>
these and other types of projects we offer cost-effective Photo <br>
CD and desktop scans. Our customer service representatives will <br>
be happy to discuss your projects and make appropriate <br>
recommendations. They will recommend the right solution for <br>
every job.<br>

already at 10X growth over last year.
