        <br>            BASELINE STUDIES<br><br>Minnow scientists have conducted baseline studies in support of <br>greenfield development, expansions, decommissioning and closure <br>planning.  Descriptions of representative projects that were <br>managed by our staff are provided below:<br><br>Pipeline Crossing (Minera Alumbrera, Argentina).  Baseline <br>conditions were evaluated at the location of various stream <br>crossings of a concentrate pipeline along a 200-km route.  <br>Water, sediment, benthic invertebrates and fish were evaluated.  <br>The field program was also used as an opportunity to train mine <br>staff in sample collection methods.<br><br>Mine Closure (East Kemptville Tin Mine, Yarmouth, NS).  The <br>study involved the design and implementation of a field program <br>to characterize the conditions in the downstream environment <br>since closure and included water and sediment chemistry, <br>sediment toxicity, benthic and fish community assessment.  The <br>findings of the study were documented in an Environmental <br>Baseline Report and presented to the DFO, Environment Canada, <br>provincial  and representatives of a local public monitoring <br>committee.<br><br>New Mine (Noranda, Half Mile Lakes, NB).  Environmental <br>implications associated with developing a base metal mine site <br>in Northern New Brunswick was evaluated as part of the overall <br>feasibility assessment.  A study was undertaken to characterize <br>the baseline condition of the aquatic and terrestrial <br>environments and to assess impacts associated with mine <br>development.<br><br>Concentrate Handling Facility (Noranda, Belledune, NB).  Water, <br>soils and air were sampled as part of an impact assessment of a <br>proposed concentrate handling facility.  The project required <br>presentations in Fredericton to the DOE.  An Environmental <br>Impact Report was prepared, the project was approved, and a <br>Certificate of Approval issued.<br><br>New Mines (Kinross Gold Corporation, Timmins, ON).  The existing <br>water quality monitoring program was modified to improve <br>baseline information for properties that will potentially be <br>developed, thus allowing for greater flexibility in future <br>decision-making.<br><br>REGULATORY APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AUTHORIZATIONS<br><br>Our knowledge of the rules, the technical issues, and our <br>credibility with regulators benefits clients by minimizing the <br>schedule delays and costs that often accompany regulatory <br>approval processes.  Examples of projects managed by Minnow <br>scientists are listed below.<br><br>Fisheries Act Authorization (FAA) for Mine Site Decommissioning <br>and Watercourse Diversion (Billiton Base Metals, formerly Rio <br>Algom Limited, Elliot Lake, ON).  The mine Decommissioning Plan <br>was conducted under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act <br>(CEAA) with the CNSC (formerly AECB) and DFO as joint <br>responsible authorities. The project involved removal of dams in <br>a 10-lake watercourse diversion system and an FAA was required <br>based on concerns about potential habitat loss.  Minnow staff <br>reasoned that system productivity after dam removal would be <br>equal to or greater than prior to dam removal.  The process was <br>successfully modified to allow removal of dams over a 10-year <br>period without triggering CEAA for each removal. <br><br>C-of-A Amendment for Operating Mine (Agrium Phosphate Mine, <br>Kapuskasing, ON). A study was designed and implemented to assess <br>the effects of mine effluent discharges and associated <br>phosphorus loadings on the Lost River system.  The project <br>involved water and sediment sampling, benthic invertebrate <br>community and fish assessments, preparation of an interpretive <br>report, and extensive negotiations with MOE at the district, <br>regional and branch offices.<br><br>Environmental Assessment (EA) for Hydroelectric Facility <br>(McGarth Energy, NS). The project included adherence to federal <br>Fisheries Act and Provincial Environmental Assessment (EA) <br>regulatory processes.  Consequently, the project involved <br>development and implementation of a comprehensive public <br>consultation and communication program to meet federal and <br>provincial legislative requirements.  Hydrology and limnology of <br>an upstream lake were key issues in this project.<br><br>C-of-A Amendments at Co-Generation Facility (Tractebels West <br>Windsor Power Plant, ON).   The project ranged from the initial <br>Phase I Environmental Site Assessment through to the completion <br>of supporting environmental studies, including regulatory and <br>public consultation activities, overseeing the completion of <br>each respective permit application, conducting the detailed <br>financing and associated due diligence reviews, preparation of C-<br>of-A amendments to reflect modifications during construction and <br>Equipment Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor support.<br><br>Fisheries Act Authorization and Compensation for River Diversion <br>(Agrium Phosphate Mine, Kapuskasing, ON).  A study was designed <br>and implemented to assess the pre- and post-diversion productive <br>capacity of a 1500 metre section of river to be diverted for an <br>open pit expansion.  Productivity was determined through the <br>evaluation of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate communities, <br>aquatic habitat and sediment quality.  An interpretive report <br>was submitted to DFO in fulfillment of the FAA.<br><br>Studies and Stakeholder Consultation to Support Development of <br>Co-Generation Facility (Tractebel Inc.s proposed facility at a <br>pulp and paper mill in Thunder Bay, ON).  The scope of the <br>project included a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment and <br>compilation of an air inventory to meet the air permitting <br>requirements associated with facility development.  Additional <br>responsibilities included development and implementation of a <br>comprehensive public consultation program and extensive <br>regulatory agency (i.e., local MOE and OMNR representatives) <br>liaison.  <br><br>Studies to Secure World Bank Funding (Confidential Mine in South <br>America).  An environmental study was completed that showed low <br>dissolved oxygen, not elevated metal concentrations, was <br>responsible for impacts downstream of a South American mining <br>operation.  An assimilative capacity model was developed to <br>optimize BOD treatment. Identification and resolution of the <br>cause of observed biological impacts downstream of the site <br>resulted in approval of continued funding.<br><br>ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS MONITORING (EEM)<br><br>Minnow scientists are intimately familiar with the requirements <br>of the federal EEM programs under the Fisheries Act as a result <br>of:<br><br>preparing Environment Canadas technical guidance manual for <br>conducting pulp and paper EEMs; <br>participation in various EEM technical working groups for pulp <br>and paper and mining EEMs; <br>participation in EEM studies at 25 pulp and paper mills in Cycle <br>1 and 2; <br>presenting a summary of 25 First Cycle EEM study results at <br>Ontario and Maritime pulp and paper industry association <br>meetings; <br>managing EEM studies at numerous pulp and paper mills, including <br>Thunder Bay ON, Dryden ON, Espanola ON, Marathon ON, Sault Ste. <br>Marie ON, Dalhousie NB, and East River NS; <br>managing a multi-mine, watershed-wide EEM study associated with <br>closed mines in Elliot Lake ON; and <br>designing and managing EEMs at mines in Williams Lake BC, <br>Kapuskasing ON and Argentina South America. <br>We are particularly proud of the quality of our EEM work.  <br>Projects managed by Minnow scientists have been well received by <br>our clients and their stakeholders (shareholders and general <br>public).  In addition, our contribution to individual EEM <br>projects and our participation in national workshops and <br>seminars has provided us with an excellent reputation with <br>industry and regulators across Canada.  Our knowledge of the <br>rules, the technical issues, and our credibility with regulators <br>minimizes the time and effort associated with study design <br>approval.  Our study reports are clear, concise and technically <br>sound.<br><br>MONITORING DESIGN AND GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT<br><br>The expertise and experience of Minnow scientists are sought by <br>both private sector and government clients to design monitoring <br>programs, develop assessment methods, derive generic and site-<br>specific environmental criteria, and develop technical guidance <br>documents.  Past project experiences of our staff are briefly <br>described below.<br><br>Streamlining Aquatic Monitoring Requirements (Rio Algom Limited <br>and Denison Mines Limited, Elliot Lake, ON).  Monitoring <br>requirements associated with 11 closed uranium mines were <br>substantially modified to reduce the emphasis on water quality <br>monitoring and include biological and sediment monitoring on a <br>five-year cycle.  Total annual monitoring costs were reduced by <br>half, with triggers for future reductions as environmental <br>improvements are demonstrated.<br><br>Monitoring Program Re-Design (Agrium, Kapuskasing, ON).  <br>Monitoring requirements associated with a Fisheries Act <br>Authorization and Certificate of Approval are being harmonized <br>and streamlined to improve overall cost-effectiveness of <br>receiving environment monitoring.<br><br>Technical Support related to finalizing the updated Metal Mining <br>Effluent Regulations of the federal Fisheries Act.  (Environment <br>Canada, Ottawa, ON). <br><br>Technical Guidance Manuals <br><br>for conducting EEM studies at Canadian pulp and paper mills <br>according to updated requirements of the federal Fisheries Act <br>(Environment Canada, Ottawa, ON). <br>for controlling toxicity test precision in laboratory toxicity <br>tests using reference toxicants (Environment Canada, Ottawa, <br>ON).  <br>Criteria Development<br><br>Water Quality Objectives  Literature review and data summaries <br>for various organic and inorganic substances (Ontario Ministry <br>of Environment). <br>Canadian Water Quality Guidelines - Literature review and data <br>summaries for various organic substances (Environment Canada). <br>Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines  Preparation of supporting <br>documents for various pesticides and metals (Environment Canada <br>and Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment). <br>Review of  International Quality Criteria for Marine and <br>Freshwater Sediments (British Columbia Ministry of Environment, <br>Lands and Parks). <br>Site-Specific Water Quality Guideline for arsenic (Cogema <br>Resources Inc., Saskatchewan). <br><br>IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENTS<br><br>It has become increasingly important for companies to quantify <br>and understand the environmental risks associated with current <br>and future operations.  Some of the projects managed by Minnow <br>scientists in the past are described below.<br><br>The risks and liabilities associated with a fuel processing <br>plant operating in a dense residential area were evaluated.  The <br>project scope included assessment of raw material and finished <br>product transportation practices as well as facility operations. <br><br>An impact assessment of an ore concentrate handling facility <br>identified that accumulated ore concentrates in an estuarine <br>harbour were largely in an inert, non-biologically available <br>form using benthic community evaluation, toxicity tests and <br>sequential extraction analyses.  Impairment was shown to be <br>minimal and localized indicating that harbour dredging would be <br>unnecessary.<br><br>A risk assessment of a landslide in South America involved <br>evaluation of the extent of ecological impacts, identification <br>of probable recovery processes and estimation of the rate of <br>ecological recovery.<br><br>A risk assessment associated with a metal concentrate pipeline <br>spill involved evaluation of water and sediment quality, <br>hydrology, benthic invertebrate ecology and resident fisheries.<br><br>Assessment of contaminant impacts associated with the proposed <br>Voiseys Bay Nickel mine development in Newfoundland involved <br>spatial and temporal modeling of metal contaminant behaviour and <br>cumulative impacts among valued ecosystem components (VECs).  <br>The project was completed in support of a Joint Federal CEAA and <br>Provincial EA panel.  Results were well received at hearings and <br>approved by the panel.<br><br>SPECIES INVENTORY AND HABITAT EVALUATIONS<br><br>Minnow scientists have completed numerous habitat <br>classifications and species inventories as part of Environmental <br>Effects Monitoring (EEM) studies conducted in marine and <br>freshwater environments in accordance with Fisheries Act <br>requirements.  Some examples of projects that were led by our <br>staff include:<br><br>Species at Risk and Fish Habitat Screening Assessments (Williams <br>Operating Corporation, Marathon, ON). The project was undertaken <br>to support decision-making regarding potential mine expansion.  <br>The project also involved consideration of key stakeholders.  A <br>study was subsequently undertaken to collect baseline data that <br>would support acquisition of environmental approvals.<br><br>Habitat Assessment Associated with Potential Fisheries Act <br>Authorization (North American Palladium, Thunder Bay, Ontario).  <br>Implications of dam realignment were assessed with respect to <br>potential effects on fish habitat, requirements for a Fisheries <br>Act Authorization (FAA), and the potential to trigger an <br>Environmental Assessment under CEAA.  <br><br>Fisheries Act Authorization for a Sub-Watershed Habitat <br>Restoration (Stanleigh Mine Decommissioning, Rio Algom Limited, <br>Elliot Lake, ON).  Approval was sought to remove dams that had <br>been constructed for the management of water during uranium mine <br>operation.  An integrated approval respecting all dams was <br>obtained, allowing the client, with the completion of <br>rehabilitation and monitoring, to be free of environmental <br>liability at the site.  The project involved planning for <br>dewatering, design and construction of stream channels, and the <br>restoration or augmentation of aquatic and riparian habitat.  <br>Ecological recovery of the system is being monitored to confirm <br>the effectiveness of ecological restoration measures.<br><br>Impact of a Landslide on Aquatic Habitat (confidential South <br>American mine).  Physical and ecological impacts associated with <br>a landslide were assessed by comparing reference habitat and <br>aquatic communities, located in the same river and other, <br>similar rivers, to those in the affected area.  Probable <br>recovery processes were identified and rates of recovery were <br>predicted.<br><br>SENIOR ADVISORY INPUT<br>With more than 10 years experience apiece, Minnows senior <br>scientists impart to clients the benefit of involvement in <br>studies at multiple industrial facility types, in numerous <br>regulatory jurisdictions, and reflecting a wide range of <br>environment types and conditions.  Examples of past projects <br>that highlight the senior, strategic and technical input <br>provided by Minnow scientists are briefly described below.<br><br>Contaminant Impact Assessment for Voiseys Bay Nickel Company <br>(Newfoundland). Potential contaminant impact among various <br>valued ecosystem components (VECs) was assessed with respect to <br>construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the <br>proposed development.  The project included preparation for CEAA <br>hearings (Panel Review).<br><br>Optimization of Remedial Solutions (Noranda Dalhousie, NB and <br>confidential South American Mine).  Anticipated costly <br>engineering solutions were re-directed after further <br>investigation of ecological communities identified that <br>environmental impacts were due to factors other than what had <br>been concluded in previous studies conducted at the sites.  Once <br>the causes were correctly identified, monitoring and remedial <br>efforts were appropriately directed and significant cost savings <br>were realized.<br><br>Streamlining Aquatic Monitoring Programs (Rio Algom Limited, <br>Denison Mines Limited, Agrium Inc., Kinross Gold).  Existing <br>monitoring requirements have been harmonized (among regulatory <br>agencies), optimized with respect to key issues and <br>areas/species of concern, and resulted in better understanding <br>of environmental conditions, while usually also reducing the <br>overall cost and effort associated with monitoring.<br><br>Review of the Provincial Water Quality Objective for Arsenic <br>(Ontario Mining Association). Strategic and technical advice was <br>provided to the OMA as part of their review of proposed changes <br>to the Provincial Water Quality Objective (Protection of Aquatic <br>Life) for arsenic.  The scientific rationale, quality of key <br>data, and potential research needs were evaluated.<br><br>Development of EEM Technical Guidance and Participation in <br>Expert Working Groups.  The scientists at Minnow were invited <br>(by both industry and government) to contribute to various <br>stages of development of the EEM requirements for the pulp and <br>paper and mining sectors.<br> <br>COMMUNICATIONS AND TRAINING <br><br>Minnow scientists are adept at presenting environmental concepts <br>and information at a level commensurate with the experience and <br>knowledge of the target audience.  We have supported clients at <br>conferences, public consultations, regulatory negotiations, and <br>by preparing press releases. Some examples of the past <br>experience of our staff are presented below.<br><br>Development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) (Minera <br>Alumbrera, Argentina).  A field study  conducted in the summer <br>of 1999 was used as a training opportunity so mine environment <br>staff could undertake monitoring in the future.  SOPs were <br>developed for each aspect of the program to be used as reference <br>material and to ensure reproducibility and quality. <br><br>Preparation of a Quality Assurance Manual (Noranda, Belledune <br>Smelter, NB).   A QAM was developed for an environmental <br>sampling program at the smelter.  The project involved close <br>collaboration with smelter staff and the incorporation of <br>standard operating procedures developed by the site staff.  The <br>final document was provided to the local Department of <br>Environment in fulfillment of a C-of-A condition.<br><br>Environmental Awareness Training (Rio Algom Limited).  As part <br>of a two-day workshop for Environmental Managers at all <br>international operations, technical leadership was provided in <br>sessions on environmental impact assessment and baseline <br>studies, including effective study design, key methods, <br>potential pitfalls, and case histories.<br><br>Preparation of Environmental Newsletters (Avenor, Ottawa, ON).  <br>Various types of environmental studies, such as fish surveys, <br>benthic community assessments, and evaluation of lichens and <br>mosses were outlined in sequential newsletters for distribution <br>among pulp and paper mill employees and shareholders.<br><br>Preparation of Annual Environmental Report (Avenor, Ottawa, <br>ON).  Prepared the technical content for the annual <br>environmental report in association with corporate staff and <br>public relations consultants.<br><br>Development of Terms of Reference and Protocols Manuals (Mount <br>Polley Mining Corporation, Likely, BC).  Framework and <br>implementation guidance, including measurement protocols, were <br>developed for Mount Polley Biological Monitoring Program.<br><br>

              Minnow Environmental Inc. has implemented one of <br>
the largest integrated environmental effect <br>
monitoring studies conducted in Canada to date.  <br>
The Serpent River Watershed Monitoring Program <br>
focussed on 20 lakes and 21 river stations.  In <br>
doing so, it has rationalized previously <br>
disparate monitoring, saving two mining companies <br>
annual costs of approximately $1 million.<br>
<br>
Minnow Environmental Inc. has effectively <br>
conducted a number of resource evaluations <br>
required under the Fisheries Act, resulting in <br>
successful approvals.<br>
<br>
Within one year of operation, Minnow <br>

              Minnow Environmental Inc. has implemented one of <br>
the largest integrated environmental effect <br>
monitoring studies conducted in Canada to date.  <br>
The Serpent River Watershed Monitoring Program <br>
focussed on 20 lakes and 21 river stations.  In <br>
doing so, it has rationalized previously <br>
disparate monitoring, saving two mining companies <br>
annual costs of approximately $1 million.<br>
<br>
Minnow Environmental Inc. has effectively <br>
conducted a number of resource evaluations <br>
required under the Fisheries Act, resulting in <br>
successful approvals.<br>
<br>
Within one year of operation, Minnow <br>
Environmental became a major player in the <br>
provision of Aquatic Environmental Assessment  <br>
Services in Canada.
