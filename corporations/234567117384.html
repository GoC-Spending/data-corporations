What is Reverse Engineering?<br>
<br>
Reverse engineering (RE) is the process of discovering the technological principles of a device, object or system through analysis of its structure, function and operation. It often involves taking something (e.g., a mechanical device, electronic component, or software program) apart and analyzing its workings in detail to be used in maintenance, or to try to make a new device or program that does the same thing without copying anything from the original.Reverse engineering has its origins in the analysis of hardware for commercial or military advantage [1]. The purpose is to deduce design decisions from end products with little or no additional knowledge about the procedures involved in the original production. The same techniques are currently being researched for application to legacy software systems, not for industrial or defense ends, but rather to replace incorrect, incomplete, or otherwise unavailable documentation.<br>
<br>
Reverse Engineering Services<br>
<br>
Proto3000 offers the following Reverse Engineering Services:<br>
<br>
Part-to-CAD Modeling <br>
3D Laser Scanning <br>
3D CAD Archiving <br>
Surface Capturing <br>
3D Artistic Digital Sculpting <br>
<br>
Reasons for Reverse Engineering:<br>
<br>
Interoperability<br>
Lost documentation: Reverse engineering often is done because the documentation of a particular device has been lost (or was never written), and the person who built it is no longer available.<br>
Integrated circuits often seem to have been designed on obsolete, proprietary systems, which means that the only way to incorporate the functionality into new technology is to reverse-engineer the existing chip and then re-design it.<br>
Product analysis. To examine how a product works, what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential patent infringement.<br>
Digital update/correction. To update the digital version (e.g. CAD model) of an object to match an &quot;as-built&quot; condition.<br>
Academic/learning purposes. <br>
Learning: learn from others&#39; mistakes. Do not make the same mistakes that others have already made and subsequently corrected<br>
Reverse engineering of mechanical devices<br>
<br>
As computer-aided design (CAD) has become more popular, reverse engineering has become a viable method to create a 3D virtual model of an existing physical part for use in 3D CAD, CAM, CAE or other software. The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model. The physical object can be measured using 3D scanning technologies like CMMs, laser scanners, structured light digitizers or computed tomography. The measured data alone, usually represented as a point cloud, lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of NURBS surfaces or a CAD model. Reverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products or to assess competitors&#39; products. It is used to analyze, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential patent infringement, etc. Value engineering is a related activity also used by businesses. It involves deconstructing and analyzing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.<br>

                            Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a computerized procedural method, which enables engineers to predict how a product reacts to real-world forces, such as vibration, heat, fluid flow and such physical effects. The purpose of performing such an analysis is to determine if a part or model will break or function the way it was designed. <br>
<br>
An FEA software breaks down your product, model or part into a large number of finite elements. Our Engineers, using mathematical equations, calculate and predict the behaviour of each elements. The FEA software then adds up all the individual behaviours and presents  these physical effects by creating a coloured map for a better visual. <br>
<br>
After our engineers are finished with your FEA files, you may choose to keep your CAD file or our 3D Engineering Services Team can 3D print the model as a proper visualization tool. <br>
<br>
FEA helps predict the following physical behaviours of a product or part: <br>
Mechanical Stress <br>
Heat Transfer <br>
Fatigue <br>
Motion <br>
Electrostatics <br>
Mechanical Vibration <br>
Fluid Flow <br>
Plastic Injection Molding <br>
<br>
3D Engineering Services are used to help design products or simple parts prior to mass production. Our 3D Engineering Services Team will help you visualize the stress point of your engineered model. This model will help our engineers to better understand where they will need to put more emphasis on using more reinforcements. <br>

                            Proto3000 offers handheld measurement tools which allow you to compare your CAD files and 3D printed prototypes  by inspecting large parts or complex surfaces. In order to verify dimensional properties, a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) is usually required. Most CMM tools require you to be in a controlled environment, however, the Proto3000 Inspection Services Team knows no limits. Our 3D Engineering Team is equipped with the latest and most accurate CMM selection to perform Part-to-CAD comparisons based on your needs. <br>
<br>
We are able to travel to your location at no extra cost to make sure your CAD file and your 3D prototypes are accurate and ready for mass production.  We recognize that CMM are not always accessible to you or your staff; therefore, we offer to perform Part-to-CAD services without you having to purchase the equipment required for such tasks. <br>
<br>
Here is how it works:<br>
Our Inspection Services Team will travel to your location and simply use a handheld portable inspection device or 3D laser scanner to scan your 3D Printed parts or models. They quickly measure your parts while the inspection software automatically inputs data to be compared with the measured CAD file. Deviations and out-of-tolerance conditions are displayed in real-time using colour coded maps right in front of your eyes. The Inspection Sevices Team takes the measurements and customizes the automatically generated data in an inspection report, which is later delivered to you. Part-to-CAD Inspection is a cost effective and rapid solution, which will help you avoid unwanted mistakes prior to the mass production stage of your prototype. We guarantee to deliver accurate and fast results based on every customer&#39;s individual needs. <br>
<br>
Benefits of Performing a Part-to-CAD Inspection: <br>
 -Machines are portable and easy to set up on site<br>
-No moving parts or arms are needed for support, allowing for greater range of movement<br>
-No laser beam to worry about blocking during inspection routine<br>
-Powerful referencing capabilities <br>
-Improved accuracy and usability<br>
-A cost-effective and rapid solution <br>

What is Reverse Engineering?<br>
<br>
Reverse engineering (RE) is the process of discovering the technological principles of a device, object or system through analysis of its structure, function and operation. It often involves taking something (e.g., a mechanical device, electronic component, or software program) apart and analyzing its workings in detail to be used in maintenance, or to try to make a new device or program that does the same thing without copying anything from the original.Reverse engineering has its origins in the analysis of hardware for commercial or military advantage [1]. The purpose is to deduce design decisions from end products with little or no additional knowledge about the procedures involved in the original production. The same techniques are currently being researched for application to legacy software systems, not for industrial or defense ends, but rather to replace incorrect, incomplete, or otherwise unavailable documentation.<br>
<br>
Reverse Engineering Services<br>
<br>
Proto3000 offers the following Reverse Engineering Services:<br>
<br>
Part-to-CAD Modeling <br>
3D Laser Scanning <br>
3D CAD Archiving <br>
Surface Capturing <br>
3D Artistic Digital Sculpting <br>
<br>
Reasons for Reverse Engineering:<br>
<br>
Interoperability<br>
Lost documentation: Reverse engineering often is done because the documentation of a particular device has been lost (or was never written), and the person who built it is no longer available.<br>
Integrated circuits often seem to have been designed on obsolete, proprietary systems, which means that the only way to incorporate the functionality into new technology is to reverse-engineer the existing chip and then re-design it.<br>
Product analysis. To examine how a product works, what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential patent infringement.<br>
Digital update/correction. To update the digital version (e.g. CAD model) of an object to match an &quot;as-built&quot; condition.<br>
Academic/learning purposes. <br>
Learning: learn from others&#39; mistakes. Do not make the same mistakes that others have already made and subsequently corrected<br>
Reverse engineering of mechanical devices<br>
<br>
As computer-aided design (CAD) has become more popular, reverse engineering has become a viable method to create a 3D virtual model of an existing physical part for use in 3D CAD, CAM, CAE or other software. The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model. The physical object can be measured using 3D scanning technologies like CMMs, laser scanners, structured light digitizers or computed tomography. The measured data alone, usually represented as a point cloud, lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of NURBS surfaces or a CAD model. Reverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products or to assess competitors&#39; products. It is used to analyze, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential patent infringement, etc. Value engineering is a related activity also used by businesses. It involves deconstructing and analyzing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.<br>

 Finite Element Analysis (FEA) Services <br>
<br>
Finite Element Analysis is a computerized method for predicting how your product will be reacting to outside forces, such as vibration, heat, fluid flow and physical effects. Finite Element Analysis Services are used in the product development process to push your prototype to its limits and to determine how it will react to extreme exertion.<br>
<br>
General Applications Design Services <br>
<br>
During this part of the processing development stage our Engineering Services Team will design your CAD files to be able to visualize the outlook of your models.<br>
Our General Applications Design Services team will be able to determine the best solution for your idea based on which industry you will be targeting with your design and which general application you will be using the prototype for. Aesthetics, Finishing-Ability and Cost-Effectiveness are all important factors to take into consideration. <br>
<br>
Downstream Applications Design Services <br>
<br>
Manufacturing-ability also affects how your design will look. The Proto3000 Engineering Services Team takes Cost Effectiveness, Durability and Functionality into consideration when designing models for downstream applications. <br>
What will your prototype be used for after it is designed? Will it be used for low or high volume manufacturing? These are important questions to be asked before deciding to take advantage of our General or Downstream Application Design Services. <br>

                            Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a computerized procedural method, which enables engineers to predict how a product reacts to real-world forces, such as vibration, heat, fluid flow and such physical effects. The purpose of performing such an analysis is to determine if a part or model will break or function the way it was designed. <br>
<br>
An FEA software breaks down your product, model or part into a large number of finite elements. Our Engineers, using mathematical equations, calculate and predict the behaviour of each elements. The FEA software then adds up all the individual behaviours and presents  these physical effects by creating a coloured map for a better visual. <br>
<br>
After our engineers are finished with your FEA files, you may choose to keep your CAD file or our 3D Engineering Services Team can 3D print the model as a proper visualization tool. <br>
<br>
FEA helps predict the following physical behaviours of a product or part: <br>
Mechanical Stress <br>
Heat Transfer <br>
Fatigue <br>
Motion <br>
Electrostatics <br>
Mechanical Vibration <br>
Fluid Flow <br>
Plastic Injection Molding <br>
<br>
3D Engineering Services are used to help design products or simple parts prior to mass production. Our 3D Engineering Services Team will help you visualize the stress point of your engineered model. This model will help our engineers to better understand where they will need to put more emphasis on using more reinforcements. <br>

                            Proto3000 offers handheld measurement tools which allow you to compare your CAD files and 3D printed prototypes  by inspecting large parts or complex surfaces. In order to verify dimensional properties, a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) is usually required. Most CMM tools require you to be in a controlled environment, however, the Proto3000 Inspection Services Team knows no limits. Our 3D Engineering Team is equipped with the latest and most accurate CMM selection to perform Part-to-CAD comparisons based on your needs. <br>
<br>
We are able to travel to your location at no extra cost to make sure your CAD file and your 3D prototypes are accurate and ready for mass production.  We recognize that CMM are not always accessible to you or your staff; therefore, we offer to perform Part-to-CAD services without you having to purchase the equipment required for such tasks. <br>
<br>
Here is how it works:<br>
Our Inspection Services Team will travel to your location and simply use a handheld portable inspection device or 3D laser scanner to scan your 3D Printed parts or models. They quickly measure your parts while the inspection software automatically inputs data to be compared with the measured CAD file. Deviations and out-of-tolerance conditions are displayed in real-time using colour coded maps right in front of your eyes. The Inspection Sevices Team takes the measurements and customizes the automatically generated data in an inspection report, which is later delivered to you. Part-to-CAD Inspection is a cost effective and rapid solution, which will help you avoid unwanted mistakes prior to the mass production stage of your prototype. We guarantee to deliver accurate and fast results based on every customer&#39;s individual needs. <br>
<br>
Benefits of Performing a Part-to-CAD Inspection: <br>
 -Machines are portable and easy to set up on site<br>
-No moving parts or arms are needed for support, allowing for greater range of movement<br>
-No laser beam to worry about blocking during inspection routine<br>
-Powerful referencing capabilities <br>
-Improved accuracy and usability<br>
-A cost-effective and rapid solution <br>

                            Full Dimensional Inspection (PPAP):<br>
The Production Part Approval Process (PPAP) is a requirement of all automobile manufacturers and similar industrial manufacturers for outside parts manufacturers and suppliers. This process must be completed, submitted and approved before the part production begins.<br>
<br>
Checking Fixtures and Gauges Calibration and Certification:<br>
A valuable part of Metrology is the process of checking fixtures, gauge calibration and certification. Variable or Attribute checking fixtures need to be verified and certified before they get to be used in production. Checking fixtures and gauges needs to be measured for verification and certification at least once a year. All fixture and gauges are certified under ISO/IEC 17025:2005<br>
<br>
First Article Inspection:<br>
Before production begins, Part Inspection is used to ensure it is appropriate to the customers specification right from the beginning.<br>
2D and 3D Scanning (Digitizing):<br>
We can generate 2D and 3D part scanning, drawing or CAD, this is particularly important where non-prismatic, complex, free-form or organic geometry exists. We use one of the most accurate analog scanning probes in the industry  SP600M.<br>
<br>
Prototype Inspection:<br>
We create Pre-production prototype inspection for all purposes.<br>
<br>
Tooling Inspection:<br>

<br>
Reverse Engineering:<br>
Digitizing and Reverse Engineering Services from Part to CAD model, using our advance analog scanning probe  SP600M.<br>
<br>
Capability Studies (SPC):<br>
Statistical Process Control is the statistical analysis of measurement data collected from the manufacturing process to determining its viability and making educated corrections to a process.<br>
<br>
