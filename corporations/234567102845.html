                            The Key to Access is the next generation of portable learning technology. With the same suite of learning tools found on the Premier to Go, the Key to Access provides portable solutions for learning that have expanded beyond traditional learning environments. Complete with voice recording and the ability to play audio files, the Key to Access allows students to record notes, lectures and textbooks for listening.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Key to Access enables you to take your learning tools with you on a portable USB MP3 Player. Insert the MP3 Player into any USB Port; the floating tool bar appears allowing the user to select any of the eight different tools. The software NEVER needs to be installed on your computer. All your personal settings are saved on the Key to Access which insures that access will be the same on any computer.<br>

                            Increasingly, many publications are now created in PDF file format. Virtually all major publishers can deliver their books, magazines, etc. in a PDF format when asked to provide content in an alternate format (vs. traditional hardcopy). Additionally, major companies and institutions worldwide publish a wealth of documentation, research, policies and general communications using a PDF format. Of course, the major problem with PDF files is that, for the most part, you can only look at them on a screen, just like looking at a hardcopy page. Sure, there are some basic built-in reading tools in Adobe Acrobat Reader, but if you have ever tried to access a page of complex content (i.e. math, science) in a PDF file, you soon realize that without other tools, a PDF is really no better than a printed page.<br>
<br>
How many times have you tried to work with PDF files, only to find them inaccessible to all but a narrowly limited set of basic reading applications? Did you ever wish you could discretely select all or portions of a PDF file to be read aloud to you? What about navigating through a complicated diagram or chart? Wouldnt it be great to have other capabilities beyond traditional reading to turn PDFs into more than just content, but instead into true study tools? That is why Premier Assistive created the breakthrough PDF Equalizer!!<br>

                            The Premier AT Home program is an exciting program option that is available for purchase to school districts participating in the In-School Program.  It is designed to provide students with access to the same learning technology at home that they use while in school.  As learning challenges do not end when a student goes home, providing access to learning tools at home and year round plays an important role in empowering students. By making learning a family    affair, students and parents can embark on a learning adventure together.  Learning skills are strengthened; the family relationship is strengthened; and the opportunities for student success increase.<br>

                            Premier Literacy regularly conducts classes for entire school districts to fully teach and demonstrate all of the products in the Accessibility Suite as a means of fast-tracking your implementation. Typically, these classes qualify as in service or continuing education time for all teachers.<br>
<br>
What do we teach?<br>
<br>
For our training sessions, we focus on how to integrate literacy tools into a classroom environment and help students develop life skills that will take them beyond school. We expect all participants to come away with a good basic first-hand knowledge of how our products actually work. Depending on the size of your facility, we can accommodate up to 25 individuals in an all-day session. In addition to school personnel, we also encourage parents to attend these sessions if there is room. There are significant benefits to using these affordable products at home for students who are also using them at school.<br>

                            The French Talking Dictionary, first and foremost, is a comprehensive dictionary.  It is, however, much more than a dictionary.  The French Talking Dictionary speaks.  It reads the definition of a word aloud.  It allows the reader to look up a word without knowing exactly how it is spelled.  It also displays all the derivatives of word searched.<br>
<br>
A multi-lingual interface allows the user to choose from an English or French interface making the French Talking Dictionary an ideal product for bilingual organizations.  It can be used without leaving the current application. <br>
<br>
The French Talking Dictionary is the first product of its kind and is a powerful learning tool for students studying French as well as ESL students.  With the FTD, the power of the French language is, quite literally, at your fingertips. <br>

                            Increasingly, many publications are now created in PDF file format. Virtually all major publishers can deliver their books, magazines, etc. in a PDF format when asked to provide content in an alternate format (vs. traditional hardcopy). Additionally, major companies and institutions worldwide publish a wealth of documentation, research, policies and general communications using a PDF format. Of course, the major problem with PDF files is that, for the most part, you can only look at them on a screen, just like looking at a hardcopy page. Sure, there are some basic built-in reading tools in Adobe Acrobat Reader, but if you have ever tried to access a page of complex content (i.e. math, science) in a PDF file, you soon realize that without other tools, a PDF is really no better than a printed page.<br>
<br>
How many times have you tried to work with PDF files, only to find them inaccessible to all but a narrowly limited set of basic reading applications? Did you ever wish you could discretely select all or portions of a PDF file to be read aloud to you? What about navigating through a complicated diagram or chart? Wouldnt it be great to have other capabilities beyond traditional reading to turn PDFs into more than just content, but instead into true study tools? That is why Premier Assistive created the breakthrough PDF Equalizer!!<br>

                            The Premier AT Home program is an exciting program option that is available for purchase to school districts participating in the In-School Program.  It is designed to provide students with access to the same learning technology at home that they use while in school.  As learning challenges do not end when a student goes home, providing access to learning tools at home and year round plays an important role in empowering students. By making learning a family    affair, students and parents can embark on a learning adventure together.  Learning skills are strengthened; the family relationship is strengthened; and the opportunities for student success increase.<br>

                            Premier Literacy regularly conducts classes for entire school districts to fully teach and demonstrate all of the products in the Accessibility Suite as a means of fast-tracking your implementation. Typically, these classes qualify as in service or continuing education time for all teachers.<br>
<br>
What do we teach?<br>
<br>
For our training sessions, we focus on how to integrate literacy tools into a classroom environment and help students develop life skills that will take them beyond school. We expect all participants to come away with a good basic first-hand knowledge of how our products actually work. Depending on the size of your facility, we can accommodate up to 25 individuals in an all-day session. In addition to school personnel, we also encourage parents to attend these sessions if there is room. There are significant benefits to using these affordable products at home for students who are also using them at school.<br>
