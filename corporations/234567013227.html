                            GeoViewer is a map-based information integration and access tool that enables the user to visualize all their data on the map and access related information.<br>
<br>
Searching is done on the map or with keywords. You don&#39;t even need to know the name of a feature or asset as long as you know where it is. So, a subdivision in the west end, or a client in the East Neighbourhood, or a building in Old Towne can quickly be found and all its related reports, data, and documents retrieved.<br>
<br>
GeoViewer provides lots of useful functionality - such as PowerPoint output, the ability to select features within a geographic area, and the ability to generate reports based on selected features. Related map services and layers can be segregated into logical &quot;Topics&quot;, so that the user is never overwhelmed with the quantity of data, and different types of users and uses are clearly identified.<br>
<br>
GeoViewer is part of the SC2 GeoPortal suite of technologies available in the Municipal GeoPortal and Ontario GeoPortal services. <br>

                            DataViewer is a versatile business data query and reporting tool that maps the results by linking to GeoViewer, provides analysis through Excel, and much more.<br>
<br>
Your database records appear as a spreadsheet in DataViewer - with a couple of important additional fields: links to documents, reports, and information related to that record; and, a &quot;map it&quot; icon with the ability to launch GeoViewer and zoom into the location represented by that feature.<br>
<br>
DataViewer&#39;s &quot;Query Builder&quot; is a powerful but simple wizard-like feature for creating a query of the data. Queries can be saved and re-used, especially handy if the data are changing and you need to check quarterly or monthly. The &quot;Report Builder&quot; is another wizard-driven feature that enables one-click reporting on a database, based on the parameters which you can set and save.<br>

                            A Windows Explorer-like tool that can be integrated with OpenText and SharePoint to let users manage documents/files in a secure content management environment with direct links to GeoViewer and DataViewer.<br>
<br>
Content management can save significant time and effort and make an organization much more effective. With DocumentViewer, you get a versatile yet simple to use content management solution built in to our overall GeoPortal.<br>
<br>
A key strength of DocumentViewer is that by clicking on a link in GeoViewer or DataViewer, you are brought directly to the directory and files of interest - so you don&#39;t spend time searching the whole hierarchy of folders and files to find what you need.<br>
<br>
When DocumentViewer is added to your business systems, the rules are easily established to ensure that documents are only put into the directories that they are supposed to go in. <br>

Municipal GeoPortal is a hosted, intuitive information service. It brings mapping and business information together into one integrated view, regardless of where the data are stored to provide broad access to key information, improved collaboration, and more informed decision-making.<br>
<br>
Municipal GeoPortal uses Google maps and imagery as the geographic base upon which your maps  such as official zoning, parks, neighborhoods, planning, and health services are added.<br>
<br>
Security is a key feature. For example, our Distributed option for business data enables them to remain in your computing environment behind your firewall while still being integrated with map layers and web-based services hosted at our high availability Canadian data centre.<br>
<br>
Your Municipal GeoPortal can be quickly deployed to a specific group or to everyone across your municipality.<br>
<br>
With nothing to buy, Municipal GeoPortal is a cost effective, high impact way to improve how your organization accesses information, communicates and makes decisions. <br>
<br>
Municipal GeoPortal is available in a Map Edition; Business Edition; and, Public Edition. <br>
<br>
Municipal GeoPortal features three access tools, out-of-the-box, with no plug-ins required: GeoViewer, DataViewer, DocumentViewer.<br>

            We build and implement corporate solutions that leverage the SC2-GeoPortal technology for information publishing, integration, and access.  In so doing, clients leverage a secure cloud computing solution, with a robust security model already built, and the functionality and content already inherent in GeoPortal.  <br>
<br>
GeoPortal uses Google maps and imagery as a base - giving clients an immediate and powerful backdrop for their business information.

As of November 2010, Ontario Realty Corporation (ORC) is providing a suite of services for the Ontario government called &quot;Ontario GeoPortal&quot;. SKE has been selected as the implementation partner for these services. <br>
<br>
Ontario GeoPortal is built on the success of the ORC &quot;GeoPortal for Ontario&quot;.  With this, ORC staff can find assets (buildings, properties, parcels), see what&#39;s nearby, and access critical information about them - all through a geographic portal (SC2-GeoPortal) that integrates disparate business data and systems through a map-based interface. <br>
<br>
Business applications can also link to the Ontario GeoPortal to &quot;geo-enable&quot; themselves.  Integrated data security and access management make the solution secure and reliable.<br>
<br>
This has meant: <br>
- ORC&#39;s distributed corporate business applications can now be geo-enabled. <br>
- ORC has an OGC compliant, vendor-neutral technology solution. <br>
- ORC is better able to share information/data with clients and partners. <br>
- ORC is able to leverage other organizations&#39; data. <br>
- ORC can provide geo-services to the rest of the province - through the Ontario GeoPortal<br>
<br>
Ontario GeoPortal offers the following services: <br>
- Customer GeoPortal - Customers get their own GeoPortal with their data, non-structured content, and business systems integrated within the rich content and functionality of the ORC GeoPortal. <br>
- Custom Business Systems  ORC customers can have us develop, deploy, and support customized, location-aware business systems that leverage GeoPortal.<br>
- Business System Hosting  We host ORC&#39;s customers&#39; GeoPortal-enabled business systems on our high availability infrastructure. <br>
- 3rd Party Information Services  Customers can access specialty information products and services from various information service providers available in the ORC GeoPortal. <br>
- Specialty Map Production and GIS Services  ORC customers can use the ORC&#39;s fully equipped and staffed GIS Resource Centre for spatial data, analysis, map production and presentation needs.  <br>
- ArcGIS Server Hosting and Custom ArcGIS Development  We host ORC customers&#39; ArcGIS Server applications and/or we develop, deploy and support a customized ArcGIS-based desktop or web application.

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;SKE has been our corporate GIS implemention partner for the past several years.  Their technology and expertise has made it possible for the Ontario Realty Corporation to offer a cloud based suite of services called &quot;Ontario GeoPortal&quot; to the rest of the Ontario Government.&quot;<br>
Joseph Lin, General Manager, Geomatics Unit, Ontario Realty Corporation<br>

&quot;SKE provided very qualified technical resources right from the beginning of the project. Their on-site presence in Pakistan and hands-on work with the user community was critical to the success of the project.&quot;<br>

                            GeoViewer is a map-based information integration and access tool that enables the user to visualize all their data on the map and access related information.<br>
<br>
Searching is done on the map or with keywords. You don&#39;t even need to know the name of a feature or asset as long as you know where it is. So, a subdivision in the west end, or a client in the East Neighbourhood, or a building in Old Towne can quickly be found and all its related reports, data, and documents retrieved.<br>
<br>
GeoViewer provides lots of useful functionality - such as PowerPoint output, the ability to select features within a geographic area, and the ability to generate reports based on selected features. Related map services and layers can be segregated into logical &quot;Topics&quot;, so that the user is never overwhelmed with the quantity of data, and different types of users and uses are clearly identified.<br>
<br>
GeoViewer is part of the SC2 GeoPortal suite of technologies available in the Municipal GeoPortal and Ontario GeoPortal services. <br>

                            DataViewer is a versatile business data query and reporting tool that maps the results by linking to GeoViewer, provides analysis through Excel, and much more.<br>
<br>
Your database records appear as a spreadsheet in DataViewer - with a couple of important additional fields: links to documents, reports, and information related to that record; and, a &quot;map it&quot; icon with the ability to launch GeoViewer and zoom into the location represented by that feature.<br>
<br>
DataViewer&#39;s &quot;Query Builder&quot; is a powerful but simple wizard-like feature for creating a query of the data. Queries can be saved and re-used, especially handy if the data are changing and you need to check quarterly or monthly. The &quot;Report Builder&quot; is another wizard-driven feature that enables one-click reporting on a database, based on the parameters which you can set and save.<br>

                            A Windows Explorer-like tool that can be integrated with OpenText and SharePoint to let users manage documents/files in a secure content management environment with direct links to GeoViewer and DataViewer.<br>
<br>
Content management can save significant time and effort and make an organization much more effective. With DocumentViewer, you get a versatile yet simple to use content management solution built in to our overall GeoPortal.<br>
<br>
A key strength of DocumentViewer is that by clicking on a link in GeoViewer or DataViewer, you are brought directly to the directory and files of interest - so you don&#39;t spend time searching the whole hierarchy of folders and files to find what you need.<br>
<br>
When DocumentViewer is added to your business systems, the rules are easily established to ensure that documents are only put into the directories that they are supposed to go in. <br>

Municipal GeoPortal is a hosted, intuitive information service. It brings mapping and business information together into one integrated view, regardless of where the data are stored to provide broad access to key information, improved collaboration, and more informed decision-making.<br>

Security is a key feature. For example, our Distributed option for business data enables them to remain in your computing environment behind your firewall while still being integrated with map layers and web-based services hosted at our high availability Canadian data centre.<br>
<br>
Your Municipal GeoPortal can be quickly deployed to a specific group or to everyone across your municipality.<br>
<br>
With nothing to buy, Municipal GeoPortal is a cost effective, high impact way to improve how your organization accesses information, communicates and makes decisions. <br>
<br>

            We build and implement corporate solutions that leverage the SC2-GeoPortal technology for information publishing, integration, and access.  In so doing, clients leverage a secure cloud computing solution, with a robust security model already built, and the functionality and content already inherent in GeoPortal.  <br>
<br>
GeoPortal uses Google maps and imagery as a base - giving clients an immediate and powerful backdrop for their business information.

As of November 2010, Ontario Realty Corporation (ORC) is providing a suite of services for the Ontario government called &quot;Ontario GeoPortal&quot;. SKE has been selected as the implementation partner for these services. <br>
<br>
Ontario GeoPortal is built on the success of the ORC &quot;GeoPortal for Ontario&quot;.  With this, ORC staff can find assets (buildings, properties, parcels), see what&#39;s nearby, and access critical information about them - all through a geographic portal (SC2-GeoPortal) that integrates disparate business data and systems through a map-based interface. <br>
<br>
Business applications can also link to the Ontario GeoPortal to &quot;geo-enable&quot; themselves.  Integrated data security and access management make the solution secure and reliable.<br>
<br>
This has meant: <br>
- ORC&#39;s distributed corporate business applications can now be geo-enabled. <br>
- ORC has an OGC compliant, vendor-neutral technology solution. <br>
- ORC is better able to share information/data with clients and partners. <br>
- ORC is able to leverage other organizations&#39; data. <br>
- ORC can provide geo-services to the rest of the province - through the Ontario GeoPortal<br>
<br>
Ontario GeoPortal offers the following services: <br>
- Customer GeoPortal - Customers get their own GeoPortal with their data, non-structured content, and business systems integrated within the rich content and functionality of the ORC GeoPortal. <br>
- Custom Business Systems  ORC customers can have us develop, deploy, and support customized, location-aware business systems that leverage GeoPortal.<br>
- Business System Hosting  We host ORC&#39;s customers&#39; GeoPortal-enabled business systems on our high availability infrastructure. <br>
- 3rd Party Information Services  Customers can access specialty information products and services from various information service providers available in the ORC GeoPortal. <br>
- Specialty Map Production and GIS Services  ORC customers can use the ORC&#39;s fully equipped and staffed GIS Resource Centre for spatial data, analysis, map production and presentation needs.  <br>
- ArcGIS Server Hosting and Custom ArcGIS Development  We host ORC customers&#39; ArcGIS Server applications and/or we develop, deploy and support a customized ArcGIS-based desktop or web application.

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;SKE has been our corporate GIS implemention partner for the past several years.  Their technology and expertise has made it possible for the Ontario Realty Corporation to offer a cloud based suite of services called &quot;Ontario GeoPortal&quot; to the rest of the Ontario Government.&quot;<br>
Joseph Lin, General Manager, Geomatics Unit, Ontario Realty Corporation<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;SKE provided very qualified technical resources right from the beginning of the project. Their on-site presence in Pakistan and hands-on work with the user community was critical to the success of the project.&quot;<br>
