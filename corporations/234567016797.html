The main advantage of any BPO is the way in which it helps increase a company&#39;s flexibility. However, several sources[which?] have different ways in which they perceive organizational flexibility. In early 2000s BPO was all about cost efficiency, which allowed a certain level of flexibility at the time. Due to technological advances and changes in the industry (specifically the move to more service-based rather than product-based contracts), companies who choose to outsource their back-office increasingly look for time flexibility and direct quality control.[6] Business process outsourcing enhances the flexibility of an organization in different ways:<br>
<br>
Most services provided by BPO vendors are offered on a fee-for-service basis, using business models such as Remote In-Sourcing or similar software development and outsourcing models.[7][8] This can help a company to become more flexible by transforming fixed into variable costs.[9] A variable cost structure helps a company responding to changes in required capacity and does not require a company to invest in assets, thereby making the company more flexible.[10]<br>
<br>
Another way in which BPO contributes to a company’s flexibility is that a company is able to focus on its core competencies, without being burdened by the demands of bureaucratic restraints.[11] Key employees are herewith released from performing non-core or administrative processes and can invest more time and energy in building the firm’s core businesses.[12] The key lies in knowing which of the main value drivers to focus on – customer intimacy, product leadership, or operational excellence. Focusing more on one of these drivers may help a company create a competitive edge.[13]<br>
<br>
A third way in which BPO increases organizational flexibility is by increasing the speed of business processes. Supply chain management with the effective use of supply chain partners and business process outsourcing increases the speed of several business processes, such as the throughput in the case of a manufacturing company.[14]<br>
<br>
Finally, flexibility is seen as a stage in the organizational life cycle: A company can maintain growth goals while avoiding standard business bottlenecks.[15] BPO therefore allows firms to retain their entrepreneurial speed and agility, which they would otherwise sacrifice in order to become efficient as they expanded. It avoids a premature internal transition from its informal entrepreneurial phase to a more bureaucratic mode of operation.[16]<br>
<br>
A company may be able to grow at a faster pace as it will be less constrained by large capital expenditures for people or equipment that may take years to amortize, may become outdated or turn out to be a poor match for the company over time.<br>
<br>
Although the above-mentioned arguments favour the view that BPO increases the flexibility of organizations, management needs to be careful with the implementation of it as there are issues, which work against these advantages. Among problems, which arise in practice are: A failure to meet service levels, unclear contractual issues, changing requirements and unforeseen charges, and a dependence on the BPO which reduces flexibility. Consequently, these challenges need to be considered before a company decides to engage in business process outsourcing.[17]<br>
<br>
A further issue is that in many cases there is little that differentiates the BPO providers other than size. They often provide similar services, have similar geographic footprints, leverage similar technology stacks, and have similar Quality Improvement approaches.<br>

<br>
A KPO firm requires considerably more skilled personnel.

Whether you&#39;re an accountant, solicitor, a restaurant or an artisan cake shop, you&#39;ve spent years devoting your life to either formal education or perfecting what you actually offer<br>
 <br>
Your time, dedication and skill set is what makes you an expert in your field<br>
 <br>
And then it comes to that point from being an expert and having the knowledge to actually launching your business into the real world<br>
 <br>
And it&#39;s at that point when you give yourself the position of marketing director with little or any marketing experience<br>
 <br>
Just re-read that - &quot;You&#39;ve given the most important function of your business - the position of acquiring customers - to someone with no experience&quot;<br>
 <br>
At Altrincham HQ, we love to see business thrive and prosper, so here are some tips for those new to Social Media Marketing to give your business a fighting chance<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
START YOUR MARKETING ACTIVITY BEFORE YOUR BUSINESS LAUNCHES<br>
<br>
One of the biggest mistakes of start-up businesses is leaving marketing until tomorrow ... and then tomorrow never comes<br>
 <br>
Marketing = Awareness.   Awareness = Customers.   Customers = A Business<br>
 <br>
In an ideal world your launch campaign would start 3-4 weeks before the actual business launches to tease people up to the big launch<br>
 <br>
Social Media Marketing is not a quick fix and immediate hit for business, so having this lead-in period allows you to build an audience, develop relationships and help people understand more about your ethos and ethics<br>
 <br>
So plan your marketing ahead - set benchmarks and deadlines<br>
 <br>
NB: If you&#39;ve already launched your business and not done any marketing yet - remember today is better than tomorrow - so take action<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
CHOOSE 2 PLATFORMS AND MASTER THEM<br>
<br>
Social Media can be daunting for start-up businesses because of the sheer number of platforms and options to take<br>
 <br>
Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, Periscope, Meerkat, Blab ... and of course blogging are just a few<br>
 <br>
We always advise businesses to choose the 2 most relevant platforms and master them before looking at further options<br>
 <br>
Which platforms you choose should be dictated by your customers<br>
 <br>
Think - Where are your customer&#39;s eyes? What are the platforms they use?<br>
 <br>
Twitter and Blogging are at the core of what we do with many start-up businesses - but go back to the 2 questions above to work out which are most relevant to your audience<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
BE HUMAN AND ENGAGE MASSIVELY <br>
<br>
Social Media is not a 1 way communication channel ...<br>
Social Media is not a 1 way communication channel ...<br>
Social Media is not a 1 way communication channel ...<br>
 <br>
Repeat until you have this engrained firmly in your mind<br>
 <br>
The best thing about Social Media is it allows you to have 121 and group conversations with your audience, but so many leap on to social media as if it&#39;s a flyer, email newsletter or press release<br>
 <br>
If you&#39;re posting and switching off from Social Media, without taking the time to look what others are posting and engaging with your local network, then social media will not work for your business<br>
 <br>
Around 69-70% of our tweets that go out each day are actually conversational tweets with local businesses. Tweets that are ALL about them rather than all about us.<br>
 <br>
People love that others show an interest in them, rather than be talked to<br>
 <br>
It&#39;s true in real life and it&#39;s true on Social Media<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
BE PRESENT EVERY DAY <br>
<br>
Are you looking for a return from Social Media? Expecting big results?<br>
 <br>
So many people look at the Return On Investment (ROI) from Social Media Marketing, without considering the important measurement of Return On Effort (ROE)<br>
 <br>
The businesses that are winning big on Social Media are the businesses that are present every day, rather than occasionally turning up<br>
 <br>
For clients we plan a content calendar 3-4 months ahead which makes day to day Social Media activity much more structured and easy to do<br>
 <br>
At the heart of the content plan are the business’ marketing objectives as you have to understand why you are doing it and have benchmarks to measure against<br>
 <br>
Return On Effort isn&#39;t necessarily about posting more - it&#39;s about posting quality, posting with targets in mind and posting with focus<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
GET SOCIAL MEDIA TRAINING <br>
<br>
Learning isn&#39;t just something that happens throughout your formal education and then stops<br>
 <br>
It&#39;s a lifelong process and you&#39;ll find the most successful businesses invest time and money into their personal development and training<br>
 <br>
Social Media Training delivered by experts that goes deep into your business and works out an effective marketing strategy really is time and money well spent<br>
 <br>

The main advantage of any BPO is the way in which it helps increase a company&#39;s flexibility. However, several sources[which?] have different ways in which they perceive organizational flexibility. In early 2000s BPO was all about cost efficiency, which allowed a certain level of flexibility at the time. Due to technological advances and changes in the industry (specifically the move to more service-based rather than product-based contracts), companies who choose to outsource their back-office increasingly look for time flexibility and direct quality control.[6] Business process outsourcing enhances the flexibility of an organization in different ways:<br>
<br>
Most services provided by BPO vendors are offered on a fee-for-service basis, using business models such as Remote In-Sourcing or similar software development and outsourcing models.[7][8] This can help a company to become more flexible by transforming fixed into variable costs.[9] A variable cost structure helps a company responding to changes in required capacity and does not require a company to invest in assets, thereby making the company more flexible.[10]<br>
<br>
Another way in which BPO contributes to a company’s flexibility is that a company is able to focus on its core competencies, without being burdened by the demands of bureaucratic restraints.[11] Key employees are herewith released from performing non-core or administrative processes and can invest more time and energy in building the firm’s core businesses.[12] The key lies in knowing which of the main value drivers to focus on – customer intimacy, product leadership, or operational excellence. Focusing more on one of these drivers may help a company create a competitive edge.[13]<br>
<br>
A third way in which BPO increases organizational flexibility is by increasing the speed of business processes. Supply chain management with the effective use of supply chain partners and business process outsourcing increases the speed of several business processes, such as the throughput in the case of a manufacturing company.[14]<br>
<br>
Finally, flexibility is seen as a stage in the organizational life cycle: A company can maintain growth goals while avoiding standard business bottlenecks.[15] BPO therefore allows firms to retain their entrepreneurial speed and agility, which they would otherwise sacrifice in order to become efficient as they expanded. It avoids a premature internal transition from its informal entrepreneurial phase to a more bureaucratic mode of operation.[16]<br>
<br>
A company may be able to grow at a faster pace as it will be less constrained by large capital expenditures for people or equipment that may take years to amortize, may become outdated or turn out to be a poor match for the company over time.<br>
<br>
Although the above-mentioned arguments favour the view that BPO increases the flexibility of organizations, management needs to be careful with the implementation of it as there are issues, which work against these advantages. Among problems, which arise in practice are: A failure to meet service levels, unclear contractual issues, changing requirements and unforeseen charges, and a dependence on the BPO which reduces flexibility. Consequently, these challenges need to be considered before a company decides to engage in business process outsourcing.[17]<br>
<br>
A further issue is that in many cases there is little that differentiates the BPO providers other than size. They often provide similar services, have similar geographic footprints, leverage similar technology stacks, and have similar Quality Improvement approaches.<br>

Security- Classified information about the company can be lost<br>
Key talent retention<br>

Lack of communication between partners due to legal, language and cultural barriers can lead to complications<br>
Differentiating KPO from BPO. <br>
<br>
A KPO firm requires considerably more skilled personnel. Experts working in KPO keep on learning and accomplished professionals can power their aptitude to produce more incomes for the KPO firm.[9] The main difference between a KPO firm and a BPO firm is that in a KPO firm, the customer is included amid the whole execution process.[7] KPO firms additionally provides their customers with high end services. The pay of KPO representative is much higher than offered to the BPO worker as the individuals working for KPO are exceptionally qualified.<br>

                            The picture for many small businesses and start-ups is often the same<br>
 <br>
Whether you&#39;re an accountant, solicitor, a restaurant or an artisan cake shop, you&#39;ve spent years devoting your life to either formal education or perfecting what you actually offer<br>
 <br>
Your time, dedication and skill set is what makes you an expert in your field<br>
 <br>
And then it comes to that point from being an expert and having the knowledge to actually launching your business into the real world<br>
 <br>
And it&#39;s at that point when you give yourself the position of marketing director with little or any marketing experience<br>
 <br>
Just re-read that - &quot;You&#39;ve given the most important function of your business - the position of acquiring customers - to someone with no experience&quot;<br>
 <br>
At Altrincham HQ, we love to see business thrive and prosper, so here are some tips for those new to Social Media Marketing to give your business a fighting chance<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
START YOUR MARKETING ACTIVITY BEFORE YOUR BUSINESS LAUNCHES<br>
<br>
One of the biggest mistakes of start-up businesses is leaving marketing until tomorrow ... and then tomorrow never comes<br>
 <br>
Marketing = Awareness.   Awareness = Customers.   Customers = A Business<br>
 <br>
In an ideal world your launch campaign would start 3-4 weeks before the actual business launches to tease people up to the big launch<br>
 <br>
Social Media Marketing is not a quick fix and immediate hit for business, so having this lead-in period allows you to build an audience, develop relationships and help people understand more about your ethos and ethics<br>
 <br>
So plan your marketing ahead - set benchmarks and deadlines<br>
 <br>
NB: If you&#39;ve already launched your business and not done any marketing yet - remember today is better than tomorrow - so take action<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
CHOOSE 2 PLATFORMS AND MASTER THEM<br>
<br>
Social Media can be daunting for start-up businesses because of the sheer number of platforms and options to take<br>
 <br>
Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, Periscope, Meerkat, Blab ... and of course blogging are just a few<br>
 <br>
We always advise businesses to choose the 2 most relevant platforms and master them before looking at further options<br>
 <br>
Which platforms you choose should be dictated by your customers<br>
 <br>
Think - Where are your customer&#39;s eyes? What are the platforms they use?<br>
 <br>
Twitter and Blogging are at the core of what we do with many start-up businesses - but go back to the 2 questions above to work out which are most relevant to your audience<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
BE HUMAN AND ENGAGE MASSIVELY <br>
<br>
Social Media is not a 1 way communication channel ...<br>
Social Media is not a 1 way communication channel ...<br>
Social Media is not a 1 way communication channel ...<br>
 <br>
Repeat until you have this engrained firmly in your mind<br>
 <br>
The best thing about Social Media is it allows you to have 121 and group conversations with your audience, but so many leap on to social media as if it&#39;s a flyer, email newsletter or press release<br>
 <br>
If you&#39;re posting and switching off from Social Media, without taking the time to look what others are posting and engaging with your local network, then social media will not work for your business<br>
 <br>
Around 69-70% of our tweets that go out each day are actually conversational tweets with local businesses. Tweets that are ALL about them rather than all about us.<br>
 <br>
People love that others show an interest in them, rather than be talked to<br>
 <br>
It&#39;s true in real life and it&#39;s true on Social Media<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
BE PRESENT EVERY DAY <br>
<br>
Are you looking for a return from Social Media? Expecting big results?<br>
 <br>
So many people look at the Return On Investment (ROI) from Social Media Marketing, without considering the important measurement of Return On Effort (ROE)<br>
 <br>
The businesses that are winning big on Social Media are the businesses that are present every day, rather than occasionally turning up<br>
 <br>
For clients we plan a content calendar 3-4 months ahead which makes day to day Social Media activity much more structured and easy to do<br>
 <br>
At the heart of the content plan are the business’ marketing objectives as you have to understand why you are doing it and have benchmarks to measure against<br>
 <br>
Return On Effort isn&#39;t necessarily about posting more - it&#39;s about posting quality, posting with targets in mind and posting with focus<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
GET SOCIAL MEDIA TRAINING <br>
<br>
Learning isn&#39;t just something that happens throughout your formal education and then stops<br>
 <br>
It&#39;s a lifelong process and you&#39;ll find the most successful businesses invest time and money into their personal development and training<br>
 <br>
Social Media Training delivered by experts that goes deep into your business and works out an effective marketing strategy really is time and money well spent<br>
 <br>
