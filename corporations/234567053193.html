                            With some of the highest electricity prices in the country, staying competitive in Ontario can be a challenge for businesses. Demand Response (DR) is increasingly recognized as an effective cost-reduction strategy for industrial and commercial enterprises.<br>
<br>
An effective solution for the grid and for businesses<br>
<br>
DR has had a significant impact on Ontario’s electricity system as a resource to reduce demand peaks. High demand puts pressure on the electricity grid, and outages can occur when demand exceeds available supply.  DR helps to stabilize this balance, minimizing the need to activate expensive fossil fuel generators that pollute the environment and spike electricity prices.<br>
<br>
Demand Response can be easily implemented without having an impact on production processes. We enable a diverse range of energy consumers to participate in DR programs. If your facility is a manufacturing plant, data center, retail store, distribution center, commercial building, municipal water treatment plant or pumping station, you’re likely eligible.<br>
<br>
Our energy managers can develop a competitive Demand Response strategy for your facility at no cost to you and with no capital investment.<br>

                            Learn how to save more than $100,000/year on your Global Adjustment costs:<br>
<br>
For large electricity users, global adjustment (GA) is a charge on your monthly electricity bill used to fund various energy infrastructure programs in Ontario. This GA tariff is forecasted to continue increasing as Ontario develops more renewable power and conservation projects. It is critical to begin implementing strategies to reduce your GA – it could mean saving your facility hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br>
<br>
What is the Industrial Conservation Initiative?<br>
Businesses that participate in the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI) are those that qualify as IESO Class A consumers. These businesses pay GA based on their electricity consumption during the top five peak demands in a 12-month period. Those who can reduce their grid consumption either by electricity curtailment or by switching to on-site generators during a peak can significantly reduce their GA costs.<br>
<br>
Does your facility qualify as Class A?<br>
•	Average hourly peak demand:<br>
  o	Greater than 3 MW but less than or equal to 5 MW<br>
  o	Examples: Manufacturing, mining, quarrying, oil/gas extraction, greenhouse, refrigerated warehousing and data processing<br>
•	More than 5 MW<br>
  o	All sectors automatically qualify<br>
<br>
How Rodan Energy can help you save money:<br>
The financial benefits of curtailing electricity usage during peak hours are significant enough to outweigh the impact that disruptions can have on operations. Many Class A facility managers across the province are taking advantage of the ICI in order to save on their GA costs. The challenge, however, is predicting when the top five peaks will happen.<br>
<br>
Costs of GA rising:<br>
Ontario is continuing to build more green energy projects (since 2003 more than $21 billion has been invested in cleaner generation) under long-term (20-40 year) contracts. Together with fixed priced contracts and more conservation initiatives planned, these expenses will continue to be funded through increased GA tariffs.<br>
<br>
Global Adjustment Predictive Tool:<br>
Our predictive software analyzes your energy consumption data and alerts your facility to reduce energy usage during the five coincident peaks to significantly reduce your facility’s GA costs. We will apply our sophisticated technology, market intelligence, and unparalleled industry expertise to predict peaks and notify your business when to dial down your operations. Leave the peak-chasing to the experts.<br>
<br>
Here’s how the process works:<br>
•	Peak production plan<br>
  o	Rodan’s specialists work with you to develop a peak reduction plan (electricity reduction or back-up power systems).<br>
•	Notification<br>
  o	Our NOC issues peak reduction advisories and notifications, as well as expert care and support throughout the activation.<br>
•	M&amp;V<br>
  o	For this optional service, we measure and verify your performance, ensuring savings are properly reflected on your electricity bill.<br>

                            (PRS) Solutions At a Negligible or Zero Cost to You.<br>
<br>
Lost power means lost revenue, and it could also mean irreparable damage to your company’s operations. Rodan Energy will determine the correct Power Reliability System (PRS) to protect your business from outages that cut into your bottom line.<br>
<br>
Our Power Reliability program will protect your business from heavy losses as a result of shutdowns. Businesses located in remote areas are particularly at risk of brownouts from undependable electricity distribution. <br>
<br>
Avoid Unexpected Disruptions and Damage to Sensitive Equipment.<br>
We help assess power quality issues to avoid unplanned interruptions which can generate heavy losses for business with critical operations: loss of production, loss of services, dangerous shutdowns, expensive energy intensive restarts, and overall loss of revenue.<br>
<br>
Anticipate Impending Power Availability Problems.<br>
We provide sophisticated monitoring that enables predictive maintenance, harmonic measurement, and consumption follow-up. By tracking, alarming, and logging power quality analysis, we can help you anticipate impending availability problems. If an event occurs, the solution enables you to quickly troubleshoot the problem in order to get your processes back up and running quickly.<br>
<br>
Mitigate Effects of Harmonic Disturbances.<br>
Rodan Energy can assist you in optimizing your power infrastructure by installing equipment to mitigate the effects of disturbances. Some equipment generate voltage distortion or harmonics. Harmonic filtering reduces and eliminates the harmonics that stress the electrical network, causes outages, and potentially reduces equipment reliability and electrical device life span.<br>
<br>
Reduce the Impact of Power Outages on Critical Operations.<br>
Strategies involving maintaining or ensuring power to critical loads are essential to critical application continuity. They include critical power architectures based on relevant equipment (back up generation, uninterrupted power supplies and redundant systems). They can be designed and installed by our experienced specialists.<br>
<br>
Solutions with a negligible or zero cost to your facility.<br>
We understand that your business demands reliable, safe, and high-quality electric service. We are able to deliver this at a negligible or zero cost to you and with minimal impact to your operations, as we can often leverage revenue streams from government programs to defray the cost of power reliability solutions. Contact us to see if you qualify.<br>

                            With some of the highest electricity prices in the country, staying competitive in Ontario can be a challenge for businesses. Demand Response (DR) is increasingly recognized as an effective cost-reduction strategy for industrial and commercial enterprises.<br>
<br>
An effective solution for the grid and for businesses<br>
<br>
DR has had a significant impact on Ontario’s electricity system as a resource to reduce demand peaks. High demand puts pressure on the electricity grid, and outages can occur when demand exceeds available supply.  DR helps to stabilize this balance, minimizing the need to activate expensive fossil fuel generators that pollute the environment and spike electricity prices.<br>
<br>
Demand Response can be easily implemented without having an impact on production processes. We enable a diverse range of energy consumers to participate in DR programs. If your facility is a manufacturing plant, data center, retail store, distribution center, commercial building, municipal water treatment plant or pumping station, you’re likely eligible.<br>
<br>
Our energy managers can develop a competitive Demand Response strategy for your facility at no cost to you and with no capital investment.<br>

                            Learn how to save more than $100,000/year on your Global Adjustment costs:<br>
<br>
For large electricity users, global adjustment (GA) is a charge on your monthly electricity bill used to fund various energy infrastructure programs in Ontario. This GA tariff is forecasted to continue increasing as Ontario develops more renewable power and conservation projects. It is critical to begin implementing strategies to reduce your GA – it could mean saving your facility hundreds of thousands of dollars.<br>
<br>
What is the Industrial Conservation Initiative?<br>
Businesses that participate in the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI) are those that qualify as IESO Class A consumers. These businesses pay GA based on their electricity consumption during the top five peak demands in a 12-month period. Those who can reduce their grid consumption either by electricity curtailment or by switching to on-site generators during a peak can significantly reduce their GA costs.<br>
<br>
Does your facility qualify as Class A?<br>
•	Average hourly peak demand:<br>
  o	Greater than 3 MW but less than or equal to 5 MW<br>
  o	Examples: Manufacturing, mining, quarrying, oil/gas extraction, greenhouse, refrigerated warehousing and data processing<br>
•	More than 5 MW<br>
  o	All sectors automatically qualify<br>
<br>
How Rodan Energy can help you save money:<br>
The financial benefits of curtailing electricity usage during peak hours are significant enough to outweigh the impact that disruptions can have on operations. Many Class A facility managers across the province are taking advantage of the ICI in order to save on their GA costs. The challenge, however, is predicting when the top five peaks will happen.<br>
<br>
Costs of GA rising:<br>
Ontario is continuing to build more green energy projects (since 2003 more than $21 billion has been invested in cleaner generation) under long-term (20-40 year) contracts. Together with fixed priced contracts and more conservation initiatives planned, these expenses will continue to be funded through increased GA tariffs.<br>
<br>
Global Adjustment Predictive Tool:<br>
Our predictive software analyzes your energy consumption data and alerts your facility to reduce energy usage during the five coincident peaks to significantly reduce your facility’s GA costs. We will apply our sophisticated technology, market intelligence, and unparalleled industry expertise to predict peaks and notify your business when to dial down your operations. Leave the peak-chasing to the experts.<br>
<br>
Here’s how the process works:<br>
•	Peak production plan<br>
  o	Rodan’s specialists work with you to develop a peak reduction plan (electricity reduction or back-up power systems).<br>
•	Notification<br>
  o	Our NOC issues peak reduction advisories and notifications, as well as expert care and support throughout the activation.<br>
•	M&amp;V<br>
  o	For this optional service, we measure and verify your performance, ensuring savings are properly reflected on your electricity bill.<br>

                            Through Rodan&#39;s subsidiary, Energent, we make use of their Energy Management Information System (EMIS), a software solution which enables you to plan, make decisions and take effective action to manage energy use and costs utilizing the following solutions modules:<br>
<br>
ENERGENT EM<br>
Understanding when you are using energy is the first step in really understanding your location’s energy profile. Energent’s Energy Monitoring software makes this easy!<br>
<br>
ENERGENT ET<br>
There are multiple factors that influence energy demand and consumption. We develop the mathematical models which accurately predict your facilities’ energy use.<br>
<br>
ENERGENT GHG<br>
Energy management is about sustainability and emissions reductions as much as it is about energy savings. Easily communicate and report on your Greenhouse Gas reductions.<br>
<br>
ENERGENT PORTFOLIO MANAGER<br>
Have the ability to manage a portfolio of buildings easily from one screen. Identify facilities that are your best performers or are outliers.<br>
<br>
ENERGENT KIOSK<br>
Build awareness throughout your organization by displaying your key sustainability metrics on a kiosk!<br>
