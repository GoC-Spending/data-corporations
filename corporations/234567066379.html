                            Silicone rubber heaters consist of many layers of silicone rubber sheets that are bonded together through heat and high pressure. A fibreglass grid (which is visible on the surface) reinforces the silicone rubber sheets. It is possible to make the surface of the heaters smooth (i.e. make the grid invisible) by covering the fibreglass with a thin layer of silicone. A uniformly spiralled resistance wire web that covers the entire surface of the heater is embedded within the layers of silicone rubber. This web could be designed such that holes and cut-outs are incorporated on the heater. When silicone rubber heaters are made with a pressure sensitive adhesive backing, a thin layer of aluminium is added prior to the adhesive layer, in order to improve heat transfer and maintain its uniformity. This construction makes silicone rubber heaters an ideal solution to the requirements of many low and medium temperature applications, which do not conform to the standard shapes, sizes and dimensions of band, strip, cartridge, tubular and coil heaters.<br>

                            Flanged Immersion Heaters, both round flange and square flange models are a great choice for applications requiring larger wattages. Flanged immersion heaters are designed for installation into a pipe body, tank or pressure vessel using standard pipe size. These heaters are available in a wide selection of rates, sizes and sheath materials suitable for the heating requirements of water, air and other gases. Flanged immersion heaters are very efficient since all energy that is generated is dissipated directly into the medium which is being heated. All flanged heater models incorporate tubular heater construction welded or brazed into a carbon steel pipe flange. Nema 1 terminal enclosures are supplied with all standard units. Moisture resistant and explosion proof models are also available. A number of sheath materials like Titanium, Incoloy, Stainless Steel, Steel, and Copper can be used as required for specific applications.<br>

                            Solid State Relays - Description <br>
Solid State Relays (SSRs) are switching devices consisting of electronic components. The term &quot;Solid State&quot; means that these relays do not incorporate any moving parts in the load switching circuit.<br>
<br>
When applied properly, Solid State Relays (SSRs) will last millions of cycles due to the fact that no mechanical devices are included in the load switching circuit. The user will experience no arcing problems, and operation will be troublefree , even in polluted envirom- ents (dust,gasses, etc.) <br>
<br>
Furthermore, Solid State Relays (SSRs) increase operating speed thereby providing the possibility of choosing zero or phase angle switching. A Solid State Relay is the solution when the system designer needs to switch loads rapidly.as in all kinds of temperature control applications. Solid State Relays are used extensively in the Plastics, Packaging, Food Processing and HVAC industries and are an excellent replacement for electromechanical relays.<br>
<br>
Mercury Displacement Relays are all designed and built to meet the most exacting demands of industry. They have won their high place in the electrical field by doing the tough and tricky jobs. They have proved their ability to stand up under the most adverse conditions of temperature, dust and moisture, in all types of applications.<br>
<br>
Mercury Displacement Relays, Contactors or Switches as they are often called are hermetically sealed with high quality glass to metal seals.<br>
<br>
The stainless steel tube is totally encapsulated in high grade UL approved epoxy to prevent moisture damage and voltage breakdown through the protective coating.<br>
<br>
Inert gases internally prevent excessive arcing between the mercury and the electrodes which enables the unit to function for millions of cycles with very low contact resistance and minimum deterioration of internal parts.<br>
<br>
Mercury Displacement Relays are available in all standard coil voltages, in single, two and three pole configurations. Other coil voltages are available upon request<br>

                            Thermocouples &amp; RTDs are used in a variety of applications. Thermocouples are the temperature sensor of choice primarily in plastics extrusion, injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and blown film applications. The thermocouples favorable characteristics include good inherent accuracy, suitability over a broad temperature range, relatively fast thermal response, ruggedness, high reliability, low cost and great versatility of application. Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs) are commonly used in applications where accuracy and repeatability are important. Platinum RTDs have very repeatable resistance vs. temperature characteristics over time. RTDs are more expensive than thermocouples and are not suitable in high vibration and mechanical shock environments. At higher temperature conditions RTDs are more stable than thermocouples.<br>

                            Cartridge Heaters Metric - Description<br>
<br>
Metric &amp; Imperial high density cartridge heaters are round tubular heaters with electrical terminations on one side. These dependable heaters are made to withstand tough industrial usage. With a tolerance of +/-0.002&quot; on its outside diameter to secure a tight fit inside receptacle holes, and rock hard compaction of MgO insulation through swaging, these heaters can attain 1500ºF sheath temperature. High density cartridge heaters are available with various termination styles and mounting attachments. In high-density cartridge heaters the resistance wire loops are positioned as close as possible to the outside shell. Because the MgO powder insulation around these loops is compacted by swaging and transformed into a very hard medium, heat transmission is very efficient. Metric and Imperial cartridges can have up to 200 w/in watt densities.<br>
<br>
Cartridge Heaters are usually supplied with lead wires. The attachment of the leads to the central pins is done internally, in a 3/8 cold section. In excessively hot applications the length of this cold section could be increased. To facilitate installation and avoid excessive air pockets, cartridge heaters are made 0.004 less than the nominal size of the receptacle hole with a tolerance of +/- 0.002. Metric and Imperial cartridges can be dual-voltage, three-phase, and/or be supplied with a ground terminal. With ten different termination styles, mounting attachments and various optional features, Our high density cartridge heaters are widely used in numerous high temperature applications.<br>

                            Ceramic Infrared Heaters - Description<br>
Ceramic infrared heaters are 96% infrared energy efficient. Uses for electric infrared heat can be found in many industries and applications and can be grouped into four major categories:<br>
<br>
(a) Curing <br>
<br>
(b) Drying <br>
<br>
(c) Heating <br>
<br>
(d) Cooking <br>
<br>
(e) Saunas <br>
<br>
Within each of these major categories are literally hundreds of specific applications, and the list keeps growing as technology develops.<br>
<br>
Our ceramic infrared heaters (emitters) are manufactured with three basic emitter faces: Concave, Flat and Convex. These emitter face styles will result in the specific radiant emission pattern as shown in our Ceramic Infrared Emitters Technical Manual. The concave surface will emit a concentrated radiant pattern which is highly effective when zone heating is desired as well as radiant heating in general. Flat surface emitters will produce a uniform pattern for even heating at a close proximity between the emitter and the target being heated. Finally, the convex shaped emitter gives off a wide area<br>
pattern which is desirable in comfort heating or other applications that require a dispersed radiant emission pattern.<br>
<br>
These heaters are durable, splash-proof and have a non-corrosive finish. Maximum temperature output of up to 1292*F (700*C). Estimated life of 10,000 hours with one (1) year warranty.<br>

                            Fuzzy Logic Temperature Controllers - Description<br>
<br>
The FuzzyLogic 1/16 DIN Fuzzy Logic Temperature Controllers can easily be configured to provide precise control. The advanced Smarter Logic &quot;Fuzzy&quot; allows processes to be controlled better than ever before, with virtually no initial overshoot or temperature variations. <br>
<br>
As the control detects a process disturbance the fuzzy logic continuous decision making function quickly returns the process value to the setpoint. An optional dwell timer enables an event to be timed on or off when preset temperature is attained. In addition, self-diagnostic capabilities, sensor linearization and cold junction compensation are all performed by the powerful, single chip microprocessor.<br>

                            With over 57 years of combined experience, we&#39;ve become a leading supplier of electric heaters, temperature sensors, and temperature controls for plastics processing equipment . Our extensive knowledge has helped us design products that offer you higher productivity and minimize your downtime. In fact, our components are found on OEM equipment for injection molding and extrusion operations around the world.<br>
 <br>
The plastics industry is vast, covering many areas of industry from transport, aerospace, electronics and transportation. Injection mold machines use nozzle heaters to help soften the polymers into final products. The use of thermocouples and precise digital controllers are also used to maintain target temperatures for each application. Some manufacturers use cartridge heaters that are inserted into steel or aluminum molds that heat up large surface areas. Aluminum or steel are excellent alloys as they distribute heat at a much quicker rate than other materials. They are also fairly inexpensive and can have holes pierced to hold thermocouples (type J or K) that would maintain the operating temperature that is required. Bag forming machines often use cartridge heaters to help seal plastic bags and require precise heating so as not to melt the thin layers of plastic.<br>
 <br>
We design, engineer and distribute industrial grade process electric heaters, along with mica band heaters, ceramic band or knuckle heaters, cast aluminum /bronze heaters, cartridge/ pencil, coil, and platen heaters. We manufacture thermocouples and RTD&#39;s. In addition we offer process temperature control panels that feature the cutting edge of available technology for most Plastic Industry applications.<br>

                            An infant incubator is used mainly to keep a baby&#39;s core temperature stable at 37 degrees Celsius. Most incubators also humidify the air and can add extra oxygen.<br>
 <br>
The core temperature of the human body needs to be kept at a constant temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. If the temperature goes too high or too low, then the organs can be damaged and illness or death can result. Premature babies (babies born before they are due to be born) have undeveloped nervous systems and also lack the energy to regulate their own temperature, so their temperature needs to be maintained by an incubator. We can only give small babies a small amount of food for growing. We want them to use all of their energy for growth rather than wasting it on keeping warm, so sometimes we use the incubator to help them grow faster.<br>
 <br>
The mattress where the baby lies is completely enclosed by a clear plastic canopy. The temperature in the incubator is increased by a heater element below the mattress. A motor driven fan near the heater draws in fresh air through a filter and blows it past the heater, warming the air. The air is directed up through slots into the area above the mattress and circulated around. The air temperature is monitored by temperature sensors and is adjusted by controlling the current to the heater. The incubator can also monitor the baby&#39;s skin temperature by using a skin temperature probe, which is stuck onto the skin. The user can either set the incubator to control the temperature of the air or to control the temperature of the baby&#39;s skin (servo control mode). Supplementary oxygen can be taken in by an oxygen inlet connection where it is mixed with the fresh air through the filter. The humidity can be increased by the use of water baths (passive humidification) or by dripping water on a heated element (active humidification). The baby is cared for through special access doors called arm ports.<br>
<br>
Custom Temperature Controllers<br>
NPH offers complete microprocessor-based, multi-function custom temperature controller packages that are designed for user friendly interface. Time, temperature, humidity, speed, and motion can be monitored and controlled in a single package. Typical applications for our temperature controllers have been found in packaging, medical, foodservice, and a host of other process applications that require precision temperature control of multiple variables. Our real value is our ability to deliver exactly what you want in a temperature control package. Our engineering assists you from concept through prototypes and production.<br>
 <br>
Instrumentation used in the preparation and analysis of organic and inorganic materials requires precise control of process temperature. Depending on the type of sample, this process temperature may vary from 37°C (98.6°F) for analysis of biological cells to over 500°C (932°F) for analysis of inorganic materials. In addition, differences in incubation periods arise. Also, in medical devices, heating gases or liquids enhances patient comfort and aids recovery. Understanding all of these application requirements and having a broad base of potential thermal solutions gives NPH the ability to provide the best thermal solution for most applications.<br>
 <br>
National Plastic Heater produces many different types of electric heaters for the Medical Industry. In particular Hemodialysis machines (kidney dialysis machines) use cartridge heaters to help provide gentle thermal heat transfer to delicate fluids. NPH cartridge heaters use high grade stainless steel sheath (316), an alloy known for its corrosion resistive properties. Small tubular elements are used in hospitals and infant clinics to help keep babies warm and comfortable in small incubators or cribs. Tight temperature control is required for these heat applications .<br>
 <br>
Cartridge heaters with internal thermocouples and or RTD&#39;s (resistace temperature detectors) provide accurate temperature readings of up to 1 degree, allowing doctors and medical staff to ensure patient comfort even at the earliest stages of life.<br>
Cartridge heaters with internal thermocouples are also used to heat interior hospital beds and infant beds. With their unique dielectric strength qualities, cartridge heaters offer excellent heat transfer capabilities that improve heat up time for patients. Medical equipment use NPH cartridge heaters, tubular heaters for respiratory therapy equipment as well. NPH manufacturers cartridge heaters for radiologists and X-ray technicians that require high limit thermocouples to help regulate temperature. These heaters are made of the highest quality materials (i.e. stainless steel) to help prevent contamination and impurities to form. Silicone or epoxy seals are also used at the lead ends of cartridge heaters to offer further protection in these applications.<br>
 <br>
The laboratory environment offers numerous applications needing heat such as graduated cylinders, beakers, flasks, etc. NPH heating tapes, blankets, and jackets provide the flexibility and uniform heating to fit all your laboratory heating needs.Silicone rubber heaters are used in medical laboratories in an effort to reduce condensation and humidity that can form with patient samples. They are used in the base of a dish, near the sample tubing and provide efficient heat transfer for all mediums. Silicone rubber heaters are also used to provide efficient heat transfer to medical components and are easily replaceable during machine maintenance. They come with mechanical thermostats that are integrated into the silicone pad and have teflon leads custom made to customers required length.<br>

                             Petrochemicals often require appropriate temperatures in order to maintain there viscosity in process applications as well as in harsh external environments. Flanged immersion heaters are often chosen in order to apply a relatively moderate amount of heat (BTU&#39;s/hour) that can penetrate the heavy lubricant evenly across the tanks, containers or reservoirs. Bitumen often uses flanged heaters to help with the extraction process in the oil industry. Circulation heaters are used when circuits of flowing liquid exist and users are looking for minimal heat applications. The liquid starts off at ambient temperatures but the residual heat that already exists in a well insulated circuit is assisted with bursts of gradual cyclical heat from a heat source i.e the flanged immersion heater.<br>
 <br>
Using precise instrumentation such as a thermocouple or an RTD, users can often reach the &quot;set point&quot; or temperature required with efficient use of clean energy while achieving their goals. Temperature Control Panels are also used with process and high limit controllers to help prevent higher temperatures that could result from caking material that sticks onto the heating elements. Low watt densities assist with the preservation of heating elements but a good control that shuts off the elements in the presence of high temperatures is an effective means to preserve both the heated medium as well as the heat source eg. your NPH flanged heaters.<br>

We design, engineer, supply and distribute industrial grade process electric heaters, including flanged immersion heaters, circulation heaters, pipe insert, duct, over-the-side, air process, screw-plug immersion heaters and integrated skid system heating systems with process control panels that feature the cutting edge of available technology for most industrial applications. NPH supplies custom electric process heaters, temperature sensors, controllers and systems for trouble free service in process plants, heat transfer systems, reactors, tanks and reservoirs, lube and pump systems, air dryers, process gas heating and other applications.<br>

                            Product Description-Pipe Insert Heaters:<br>
<br>
Pipe Insert Heaters, both flanged and screw plug models are a great choice for applications requiring low watt densities such as for asphalt storage tanks and other substances having a high viscosity. In addition, removal is convenient not requiring the operator to empty the contents of their tank(s)/vessels in order to replace a failed or possibly a higher wattage heater. Pipe insert heaters are designed for installation into a pipe body using standard pipe size. These heaters are available in a wide selection of rates, sizes and sheath materials suitable for the heating requirements of very viscous materials like bunker C fuel oil, temperature sensitive materials like glucose &amp; liquid sugars, and bulk storage of corrosive materials. Pipe insert heaters are very efficient since all energy that is generated is dissipated via conduction and radiation to the inside of the pipe wall then directly through the pipe body and subsequently into the medium which is being heated. All pipe insert heater models incorporate tubular heater construction welded or brazed into a carbon steel pipe flange. Nema 1 terminal enclosures are supplied with all standard units. Moisture resistant ( Nema 4) and explosion proof  (Nema 7) models are also available. A number of sheath materials like Titanium, Incoloy, Stainless Steel, Steel, and Copper can be used as required for specific applications.<br>
<br>
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) pipe insert heaters have a standard 150 lb flange but 300 lb and 600 lb flanges are also available. Screw plug pipe insert heaters are available in NPT (National Pipe Thread) and British sizes BSP, BSPP, 1&quot;- 2 ½ &quot; NPTand British  sizes are available. To guarantee sheath material and watt density compatibility with material or process being heated consult NPH. All pipe insert heaters  we offer you including heaters for hazardous locations are CSA/NRTL and UL approved.<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br>
<br>
Finned Tubular Heaters are normally used in forced circulation heating of low temperature air, other atmospheres and gases. Typical applications include forced convection heating of air, process atmospheres, and oven atmospheres in duct environments. Steel finned tubular heaters are standard with surface temperatures limited to about 425ºC (797ºF) compared to 815ºC (1500ºF) for an alloy sheathed non-finned heater.<br>
<br>
Some applications require stainless steel materials for corrosion resistance. The most efficient finned heaters are made with steel sheath and steel fins. Steel is normally used for air heating, stainless steel for atmospheres which are humid or corrosive and monel for salt-laden humid atmospheres. Keep in mind that stainless heaters with stainless fins are very inefficient since the heat transfer rate of stainless is less than one quarter that for steel.<br>
<br>
Finned Tubular Heaters offer distinct advantages over open coil heaters: (a) they are safer to operate in that the risk of fire or electrical shock are minimized; (b) they have a much longer service life; and (c) they are more rugged requiring less maintenance than open coil heaters.<br>
<br>
We offer a standard carbon steel construction and a high temperature/ corrosion resistant stainless steel construction. As with regular tubular elements, they can be bent to a number of shapes and are available with fittings and mounting brackets as required<br>

                            Custom Multizone and Distributed Wattage Cartridge Heaters (Platen Heaters) - Zoned Versus Distributed Wattage - Definition and Application:<br>
<br>
In many industrial process heating applications we are often asked, what is the difference between &quot;distributed wattage&quot; and &quot;zoned/multizoned&quot; (multicell) cartridge heaters? These custom construction techniques are often applied to various heater types that transfer their heat via conduction. Some examples are cartridge insertion heaters, ceramic and mica band heaters as well as mica strip heaters. Usually most heaters that use a wound coil can use these construction methods to control watt density. Let&#39;s discuss some definitions before beginning.<br>
 <br>
Definitions for the Construction of Zoned/ Multizoned and Distributed Wattage Cartridge Heaters:<br>
 <br>
Coil: A resistance wire usually Nickel/Chromium (often referred to as Nichrome) that is wound around a round mandrel or ceramic core to hold the shape. When a coil is wound, it is usually done in a uniform manner.<br>
<br>
Close Wound: If all the turns of a wound coil touch, this is called a close wound coil.<br>
<br>
Open Coil: If the close wound coil is taken and stretched, it becomes an open wound coil.  Coils can also be initially wound as open coils if there is spacing between each turn of the coil.<br>
<br>
Pitch: The distance from turn to turn of an open coil.<br>
<br>
Watt Density: The wattage produced by a heater divided by the surface area of the heater. Common units of measure are W/in² and W/cm².<br>
 <br>
What Makes Distributed Wattage Cartridge Heaters: <br>
Distributed wattage is when a coil winding&#39;s pitch is not consistent throughout its entire length. Some parts of the winding are more tightly packed or wound with turns than other sections, to allow the heat profile to be more concentrated in some areas of the heater than another. The non-uniform pitched coil will have sections of closely wound coils and sections of loosely wound coils. These methods of non-uniform stretching or non-uniform winding of the coil pitch allow the heater manufacturer to increase or decrease the watt density of the heater in certain sections.  Because the coil winding in some of the sections will be closer together than other sections, the watt density will be greater in those sections.  These higher watt density heater sections will be hotter than the other sections.  Certain sections of the heater can be now be made to run hotter than other sections.  Only one set of power leads is used in this configuration, as the entire heater turns on as one unit.<br>
 <br>
Application of Distributed Wattage Cartridge/Insertion Heaters:<br>
<br>
A distributed wattage heater allows the end user to have higher heat where needed. This method of distributing heat is especially beneficial if only a small section of the heater is providing the majority of the heating or in applications where heat is needed over a long length and there tends to be a greater temperature loss (heat loss) or drop-off near the heater ends. Distributed wattage heaters are often used in platens and sealing bar applications where heat loss compensation near the ends of the heater is critical.<br>

                            Silicone rubber heaters consist of many layers of silicone rubber sheets that are bonded together through heat and high pressure. A fibreglass grid (which is visible on the surface) reinforces the silicone rubber sheets. It is possible to make the surface of the heaters smooth (i.e. make the grid invisible) by covering the fibreglass with a thin layer of silicone. A uniformly spiralled resistance wire web that covers the entire surface of the heater is embedded within the layers of silicone rubber. This web could be designed such that holes and cut-outs are incorporated on the heater. When silicone rubber heaters are made with a pressure sensitive adhesive backing, a thin layer of aluminium is added prior to the adhesive layer, in order to improve heat transfer and maintain its uniformity. This construction makes silicone rubber heaters an ideal solution to the requirements of many low and medium temperature applications, which do not conform to the standard shapes, sizes and dimensions of band, strip, cartridge, tubular and coil heaters.<br>

                            Flanged Immersion Heaters, both round flange and square flange models are a great choice for applications requiring larger wattages. Flanged immersion heaters are designed for installation into a pipe body, tank or pressure vessel using standard pipe size. These heaters are available in a wide selection of rates, sizes and sheath materials suitable for the heating requirements of water, air and other gases. Flanged immersion heaters are very efficient since all energy that is generated is dissipated directly into the medium which is being heated. All flanged heater models incorporate tubular heater construction welded or brazed into a carbon steel pipe flange. Nema 1 terminal enclosures are supplied with all standard units. Moisture resistant and explosion proof models are also available. A number of sheath materials like Titanium, Incoloy, Stainless Steel, Steel, and Copper can be used as required for specific applications.<br>

                            Solid State Relays - Description <br>
Solid State Relays (SSRs) are switching devices consisting of electronic components. The term &quot;Solid State&quot; means that these relays do not incorporate any moving parts in the load switching circuit.<br>
<br>
When applied properly, Solid State Relays (SSRs) will last millions of cycles due to the fact that no mechanical devices are included in the load switching circuit. The user will experience no arcing problems, and operation will be troublefree , even in polluted envirom- ents (dust,gasses, etc.) <br>
<br>
Furthermore, Solid State Relays (SSRs) increase operating speed thereby providing the possibility of choosing zero or phase angle switching. A Solid State Relay is the solution when the system designer needs to switch loads rapidly.as in all kinds of temperature control applications. Solid State Relays are used extensively in the Plastics, Packaging, Food Processing and HVAC industries and are an excellent replacement for electromechanical relays.<br>
<br>
Mercury Displacement Relays are all designed and built to meet the most exacting demands of industry. They have won their high place in the electrical field by doing the tough and tricky jobs. They have proved their ability to stand up under the most adverse conditions of temperature, dust and moisture, in all types of applications.<br>
<br>
Mercury Displacement Relays, Contactors or Switches as they are often called are hermetically sealed with high quality glass to metal seals.<br>
<br>
The stainless steel tube is totally encapsulated in high grade UL approved epoxy to prevent moisture damage and voltage breakdown through the protective coating.<br>
<br>
Inert gases internally prevent excessive arcing between the mercury and the electrodes which enables the unit to function for millions of cycles with very low contact resistance and minimum deterioration of internal parts.<br>
<br>
Mercury Displacement Relays are available in all standard coil voltages, in single, two and three pole configurations. Other coil voltages are available upon request<br>

                            Thermocouples &amp; RTDs are used in a variety of applications. Thermocouples are the temperature sensor of choice primarily in plastics extrusion, injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and blown film applications. The thermocouples favorable characteristics include good inherent accuracy, suitability over a broad temperature range, relatively fast thermal response, ruggedness, high reliability, low cost and great versatility of application. Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs) are commonly used in applications where accuracy and repeatability are important. Platinum RTDs have very repeatable resistance vs. temperature characteristics over time. RTDs are more expensive than thermocouples and are not suitable in high vibration and mechanical shock environments. At higher temperature conditions RTDs are more stable than thermocouples.<br>

                            Cartridge Heaters Metric - Description<br>
<br>
Metric &amp; Imperial high density cartridge heaters are round tubular heaters with electrical terminations on one side. These dependable heaters are made to withstand tough industrial usage. With a tolerance of +/-0.002&quot; on its outside diameter to secure a tight fit inside receptacle holes, and rock hard compaction of MgO insulation through swaging, these heaters can attain 1500ºF sheath temperature. High density cartridge heaters are available with various termination styles and mounting attachments. In high-density cartridge heaters the resistance wire loops are positioned as close as possible to the outside shell. Because the MgO powder insulation around these loops is compacted by swaging and transformed into a very hard medium, heat transmission is very efficient. Metric and Imperial cartridges can have up to 200 w/in watt densities.<br>
<br>
Cartridge Heaters are usually supplied with lead wires. The attachment of the leads to the central pins is done internally, in a 3/8 cold section. In excessively hot applications the length of this cold section could be increased. To facilitate installation and avoid excessive air pockets, cartridge heaters are made 0.004 less than the nominal size of the receptacle hole with a tolerance of +/- 0.002. Metric and Imperial cartridges can be dual-voltage, three-phase, and/or be supplied with a ground terminal. With ten different termination styles, mounting attachments and various optional features, Our high density cartridge heaters are widely used in numerous high temperature applications.<br>

                            Ceramic Infrared Heaters - Description<br>
Ceramic infrared heaters are 96% infrared energy efficient. Uses for electric infrared heat can be found in many industries and applications and can be grouped into four major categories:<br>
<br>
(a) Curing <br>
<br>
(b) Drying <br>
<br>
(c) Heating <br>
<br>
(d) Cooking <br>
<br>
(e) Saunas <br>
<br>
Within each of these major categories are literally hundreds of specific applications, and the list keeps growing as technology develops.<br>
<br>
Our ceramic infrared heaters (emitters) are manufactured with three basic emitter faces: Concave, Flat and Convex. These emitter face styles will result in the specific radiant emission pattern as shown in our Ceramic Infrared Emitters Technical Manual. The concave surface will emit a concentrated radiant pattern which is highly effective when zone heating is desired as well as radiant heating in general. Flat surface emitters will produce a uniform pattern for even heating at a close proximity between the emitter and the target being heated. Finally, the convex shaped emitter gives off a wide area<br>
pattern which is desirable in comfort heating or other applications that require a dispersed radiant emission pattern.<br>
<br>
These heaters are durable, splash-proof and have a non-corrosive finish. Maximum temperature output of up to 1292*F (700*C). Estimated life of 10,000 hours with one (1) year warranty.<br>

                            Fuzzy Logic Temperature Controllers - Description<br>
<br>
The FuzzyLogic 1/16 DIN Fuzzy Logic Temperature Controllers can easily be configured to provide precise control. The advanced Smarter Logic &quot;Fuzzy&quot; allows processes to be controlled better than ever before, with virtually no initial overshoot or temperature variations. <br>
<br>
As the control detects a process disturbance the fuzzy logic continuous decision making function quickly returns the process value to the setpoint. An optional dwell timer enables an event to be timed on or off when preset temperature is attained. In addition, self-diagnostic capabilities, sensor linearization and cold junction compensation are all performed by the powerful, single chip microprocessor.<br>

                            With over 57 years of combined experience, we&#39;ve become a leading supplier of electric heaters, temperature sensors, and temperature controls for plastics processing equipment . Our extensive knowledge has helped us design products that offer you higher productivity and minimize your downtime. In fact, our components are found on OEM equipment for injection molding and extrusion operations around the world.<br>
 <br>
The plastics industry is vast, covering many areas of industry from transport, aerospace, electronics and transportation. Injection mold machines use nozzle heaters to help soften the polymers into final products. The use of thermocouples and precise digital controllers are also used to maintain target temperatures for each application. Some manufacturers use cartridge heaters that are inserted into steel or aluminum molds that heat up large surface areas. Aluminum or steel are excellent alloys as they distribute heat at a much quicker rate than other materials. They are also fairly inexpensive and can have holes pierced to hold thermocouples (type J or K) that would maintain the operating temperature that is required. Bag forming machines often use cartridge heaters to help seal plastic bags and require precise heating so as not to melt the thin layers of plastic.<br>
 <br>
We design, engineer and distribute industrial grade process electric heaters, along with mica band heaters, ceramic band or knuckle heaters, cast aluminum /bronze heaters, cartridge/ pencil, coil, and platen heaters. We manufacture thermocouples and RTD&#39;s. In addition we offer process temperature control panels that feature the cutting edge of available technology for most Plastic Industry applications.<br>

                            An infant incubator is used mainly to keep a baby&#39;s core temperature stable at 37 degrees Celsius. Most incubators also humidify the air and can add extra oxygen.<br>
 <br>
The core temperature of the human body needs to be kept at a constant temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. If the temperature goes too high or too low, then the organs can be damaged and illness or death can result. Premature babies (babies born before they are due to be born) have undeveloped nervous systems and also lack the energy to regulate their own temperature, so their temperature needs to be maintained by an incubator. We can only give small babies a small amount of food for growing. We want them to use all of their energy for growth rather than wasting it on keeping warm, so sometimes we use the incubator to help them grow faster.<br>
 <br>
The mattress where the baby lies is completely enclosed by a clear plastic canopy. The temperature in the incubator is increased by a heater element below the mattress. A motor driven fan near the heater draws in fresh air through a filter and blows it past the heater, warming the air. The air is directed up through slots into the area above the mattress and circulated around. The air temperature is monitored by temperature sensors and is adjusted by controlling the current to the heater. The incubator can also monitor the baby&#39;s skin temperature by using a skin temperature probe, which is stuck onto the skin. The user can either set the incubator to control the temperature of the air or to control the temperature of the baby&#39;s skin (servo control mode). Supplementary oxygen can be taken in by an oxygen inlet connection where it is mixed with the fresh air through the filter. The humidity can be increased by the use of water baths (passive humidification) or by dripping water on a heated element (active humidification). The baby is cared for through special access doors called arm ports.<br>
<br>
Custom Temperature Controllers<br>
NPH offers complete microprocessor-based, multi-function custom temperature controller packages that are designed for user friendly interface. Time, temperature, humidity, speed, and motion can be monitored and controlled in a single package. Typical applications for our temperature controllers have been found in packaging, medical, foodservice, and a host of other process applications that require precision temperature control of multiple variables. Our real value is our ability to deliver exactly what you want in a temperature control package. Our engineering assists you from concept through prototypes and production.<br>
 <br>
Instrumentation used in the preparation and analysis of organic and inorganic materials requires precise control of process temperature. Depending on the type of sample, this process temperature may vary from 37°C (98.6°F) for analysis of biological cells to over 500°C (932°F) for analysis of inorganic materials. In addition, differences in incubation periods arise. Also, in medical devices, heating gases or liquids enhances patient comfort and aids recovery. Understanding all of these application requirements and having a broad base of potential thermal solutions gives NPH the ability to provide the best thermal solution for most applications.<br>
 <br>
National Plastic Heater produces many different types of electric heaters for the Medical Industry. In particular Hemodialysis machines (kidney dialysis machines) use cartridge heaters to help provide gentle thermal heat transfer to delicate fluids. NPH cartridge heaters use high grade stainless steel sheath (316), an alloy known for its corrosion resistive properties. Small tubular elements are used in hospitals and infant clinics to help keep babies warm and comfortable in small incubators or cribs. Tight temperature control is required for these heat applications .<br>
 <br>
Cartridge heaters with internal thermocouples and or RTD&#39;s (resistace temperature detectors) provide accurate temperature readings of up to 1 degree, allowing doctors and medical staff to ensure patient comfort even at the earliest stages of life.<br>
Cartridge heaters with internal thermocouples are also used to heat interior hospital beds and infant beds. With their unique dielectric strength qualities, cartridge heaters offer excellent heat transfer capabilities that improve heat up time for patients. Medical equipment use NPH cartridge heaters, tubular heaters for respiratory therapy equipment as well. NPH manufacturers cartridge heaters for radiologists and X-ray technicians that require high limit thermocouples to help regulate temperature. These heaters are made of the highest quality materials (i.e. stainless steel) to help prevent contamination and impurities to form. Silicone or epoxy seals are also used at the lead ends of cartridge heaters to offer further protection in these applications.<br>
 <br>
The laboratory environment offers numerous applications needing heat such as graduated cylinders, beakers, flasks, etc. NPH heating tapes, blankets, and jackets provide the flexibility and uniform heating to fit all your laboratory heating needs.Silicone rubber heaters are used in medical laboratories in an effort to reduce condensation and humidity that can form with patient samples. They are used in the base of a dish, near the sample tubing and provide efficient heat transfer for all mediums. Silicone rubber heaters are also used to provide efficient heat transfer to medical components and are easily replaceable during machine maintenance. They come with mechanical thermostats that are integrated into the silicone pad and have teflon leads custom made to customers required length.<br>

                             Petrochemicals often require appropriate temperatures in order to maintain there viscosity in process applications as well as in harsh external environments. Flanged immersion heaters are often chosen in order to apply a relatively moderate amount of heat (BTU&#39;s/hour) that can penetrate the heavy lubricant evenly across the tanks, containers or reservoirs. Bitumen often uses flanged heaters to help with the extraction process in the oil industry. Circulation heaters are used when circuits of flowing liquid exist and users are looking for minimal heat applications. The liquid starts off at ambient temperatures but the residual heat that already exists in a well insulated circuit is assisted with bursts of gradual cyclical heat from a heat source i.e the flanged immersion heater.<br>
 <br>
Using precise instrumentation such as a thermocouple or an RTD, users can often reach the &quot;set point&quot; or temperature required with efficient use of clean energy while achieving their goals. Temperature Control Panels are also used with process and high limit controllers to help prevent higher temperatures that could result from caking material that sticks onto the heating elements. Low watt densities assist with the preservation of heating elements but a good control that shuts off the elements in the presence of high temperatures is an effective means to preserve both the heated medium as well as the heat source eg. your NPH flanged heaters.<br>

                            Product Description-Pipe Insert Heaters:<br>
<br>
Pipe Insert Heaters, both flanged and screw plug models are a great choice for applications requiring low watt densities such as for asphalt storage tanks and other substances having a high viscosity. In addition, removal is convenient not requiring the operator to empty the contents of their tank(s)/vessels in order to replace a failed or possibly a higher wattage heater. Pipe insert heaters are designed for installation into a pipe body using standard pipe size. These heaters are available in a wide selection of rates, sizes and sheath materials suitable for the heating requirements of very viscous materials like bunker C fuel oil, temperature sensitive materials like glucose &amp; liquid sugars, and bulk storage of corrosive materials. Pipe insert heaters are very efficient since all energy that is generated is dissipated via conduction and radiation to the inside of the pipe wall then directly through the pipe body and subsequently into the medium which is being heated. All pipe insert heater models incorporate tubular heater construction welded or brazed into a carbon steel pipe flange. Nema 1 terminal enclosures are supplied with all standard units. Moisture resistant ( Nema 4) and explosion proof  (Nema 7) models are also available. A number of sheath materials like Titanium, Incoloy, Stainless Steel, Steel, and Copper can be used as required for specific applications.<br>
<br>
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) pipe insert heaters have a standard 150 lb flange but 300 lb and 600 lb flanges are also available. Screw plug pipe insert heaters are available in NPT (National Pipe Thread) and British sizes BSP, BSPP, 1&quot;- 2 ½ &quot; NPTand British  sizes are available. To guarantee sheath material and watt density compatibility with material or process being heated consult NPH. All pipe insert heaters  we offer you including heaters for hazardous locations are CSA/NRTL and UL approved.<br>

                            Over-the-side immersion heaters are designed for vessels where through the side immersion heaters cannot be conveniently installed. Over-the-side heaters are installed through the top of the vessel with the heated portion of the unit along the side or at the bottom of the tank. Natural circulation of the fluid inside the vessel allows for even distribution. They take up little space, eliminate the need for tank penetrations, are easily removed for service, and provide ample working space inside the tank. Custom configured elements evenly distribute heat by direct contact in numerous applications, including acid and alkali solutions. Terminal houses or lead wires are provided for power connection.<br>
<br>
These immersion heaters are available with heating elements made of copper, steel, stainless steel, cast iron, Incoloy, titanium, and PFA coated. A wide selection of kilowatt ratings, shapes and mounting methods are available to suit many different types of applications.<br>
<br>
The large variation in heating element material and shapes of over-the-side immersion heaters offers a wide selection in the application of these units. Water, oils, solvent, plating baths, salts and acids are some of the many liquids and viscous materials commonly heated with immersion heaters. Over-the-side heaters types permit portability, easy removal for cleaning of tanks and heaters, and ample working area within the tank when installed.<br>

                            PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br>
<br>
Finned Tubular Heaters are normally used in forced circulation heating of low temperature air, other atmospheres and gases. Typical applications include forced convection heating of air, process atmospheres, and oven atmospheres in duct environments. Steel finned tubular heaters are standard with surface temperatures limited to about 425ºC (797ºF) compared to 815ºC (1500ºF) for an alloy sheathed non-finned heater.<br>
<br>
Some applications require stainless steel materials for corrosion resistance. The most efficient finned heaters are made with steel sheath and steel fins. Steel is normally used for air heating, stainless steel for atmospheres which are humid or corrosive and monel for salt-laden humid atmospheres. Keep in mind that stainless heaters with stainless fins are very inefficient since the heat transfer rate of stainless is less than one quarter that for steel.<br>
<br>
Finned Tubular Heaters offer distinct advantages over open coil heaters: (a) they are safer to operate in that the risk of fire or electrical shock are minimized; (b) they have a much longer service life; and (c) they are more rugged requiring less maintenance than open coil heaters.<br>
<br>
We offer a standard carbon steel construction and a high temperature/ corrosion resistant stainless steel construction. As with regular tubular elements, they can be bent to a number of shapes and are available with fittings and mounting brackets as required<br>

                            Custom Multizone and Distributed Wattage Cartridge Heaters (Platen Heaters) - Zoned Versus Distributed Wattage - Definition and Application:<br>
<br>
In many industrial process heating applications we are often asked, what is the difference between &quot;distributed wattage&quot; and &quot;zoned/multizoned&quot; (multicell) cartridge heaters? These custom construction techniques are often applied to various heater types that transfer their heat via conduction. Some examples are cartridge insertion heaters, ceramic and mica band heaters as well as mica strip heaters. Usually most heaters that use a wound coil can use these construction methods to control watt density. Let&#39;s discuss some definitions before beginning.<br>
 <br>
Definitions for the Construction of Zoned/ Multizoned and Distributed Wattage Cartridge Heaters:<br>
 <br>
Coil: A resistance wire usually Nickel/Chromium (often referred to as Nichrome) that is wound around a round mandrel or ceramic core to hold the shape. When a coil is wound, it is usually done in a uniform manner.<br>
<br>
Close Wound: If all the turns of a wound coil touch, this is called a close wound coil.<br>
<br>
Open Coil: If the close wound coil is taken and stretched, it becomes an open wound coil.  Coils can also be initially wound as open coils if there is spacing between each turn of the coil.<br>
<br>
Pitch: The distance from turn to turn of an open coil.<br>
<br>
Watt Density: The wattage produced by a heater divided by the surface area of the heater. Common units of measure are W/in² and W/cm².<br>
 <br>
What Makes Distributed Wattage Cartridge Heaters: <br>
Distributed wattage is when a coil winding&#39;s pitch is not consistent throughout its entire length. Some parts of the winding are more tightly packed or wound with turns than other sections, to allow the heat profile to be more concentrated in some areas of the heater than another. The non-uniform pitched coil will have sections of closely wound coils and sections of loosely wound coils. These methods of non-uniform stretching or non-uniform winding of the coil pitch allow the heater manufacturer to increase or decrease the watt density of the heater in certain sections.  Because the coil winding in some of the sections will be closer together than other sections, the watt density will be greater in those sections.  These higher watt density heater sections will be hotter than the other sections.  Certain sections of the heater can be now be made to run hotter than other sections.  Only one set of power leads is used in this configuration, as the entire heater turns on as one unit.<br>
 <br>
Application of Distributed Wattage Cartridge/Insertion Heaters:<br>
<br>
A distributed wattage heater allows the end user to have higher heat where needed. This method of distributing heat is especially beneficial if only a small section of the heater is providing the majority of the heating or in applications where heat is needed over a long length and there tends to be a greater temperature loss (heat loss) or drop-off near the heater ends. Distributed wattage heaters are often used in platens and sealing bar applications where heat loss compensation near the ends of the heater is critical.<br>
