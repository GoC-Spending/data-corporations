            Pre-Compliance Test &amp; Evaluation Services<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
TJS Technical Services Inc. is able to provide a wide range of test and evaluation service, using both our resources and in cooperation with other quality test houses. We have almost 30 years of experience regulatory, environmental and product integrity testing and approvals and are therefore are capable of driving the success of your testing program and of assisting in ensuring the success of your design.<br>
<br>
The benefits that our customers typically realize from our test and evaluation services include - but are not limited to:<br>
<br>
- Faster time to market resulting from a reduction in design issues during formal certification testing<br>
- Reduced certification time due to details upfront preparation, making the evaluation process smoother<br>
- Reduced overall cost of the test and certification program, resulting in reduced risk of recycle as a result of test failure; more cost effective use of certification budget.<br>
<br>
Tests are performed either by TJS Technical Services Inc. or an accredited third party test house. Unless otherwise indicated, test equipment is calibrated in accordance with ISO 17025.<br>
<br>
Product Safety<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Most manufacturers are all too familiar with the costs and delays which result from surprises during the evaluation, design modifications and subsequent retesting. Some certification agencies offer limited technical advice but typically are unable to provide support from concept phase through to end of life. The Certification Agency high hourly rates also tend to discourage use of the service.<br>
<br>
TJS Technical Services Inc. will provide an knowledgeable and independent customized service to address your needs and to complement in-house resources to help minimize cost and effort. Examples of how we do this are as follows:<br>
<br>
- Work with your team and provide consulting advice as required<br>
- Review designs to identify issues and to help provide solutions<br>
- Perform minimal set of key tests on prototypes to reduce risk of failure during formal tests<br>
<br>
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<br>
To minimize risk of EMC non-compliance, we will review your current design, and coordinate testing at a quality test house for a minimal set of evaluation tests. The test objective is to cost-effectively identify potential issues prior to paying for the full suite of formal tests.<br>
<br>
Custom Test Requirements<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
Product Related Tests<br>
<br>
Examples of the tests that we perform are provided below.<br>
<br>
- Heating Tests: Conduct temperature/heating measurements on products either using thermocouples or infrared (non-contact) technology.<br>
- Leakage Current: Standard burn hazard and electric shock tests.<br>
- Electric Strength Tests (Hipot): High voltage electric strength and insulation strength tests up to 5kV (pre-compliance or small volume production)<br>
- Insulation Resistance Tests (Megger): High voltage insulation resistance tests up to  10 Gohm<br>
<br>
General Electrical Tests<br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
Contact us regarding your custom test needs.<br>
<br>
Facility Related Tests<br>
---------------------<br>
    <br>
- ESD Workstation Tests (ANSI/ESD S4.1): Verification of effectiveness of workstation ESD surfaces through resistance measurement in accordance with the ANSI standard S4.1.<br>
- Telecommunications/Computer Room Power Noise and Grounding: Wiring (neutral and grounding) issues in power systems can result in both safety and noise issues that can impact computer and communications equipment. We perform a series of tests to determine if there are wiring, grounding and ratings (voltage/current) concerns.

- Reduced overall cost of the test and certification program, resulting in reduced risk of recycle as a result of test failure; more cost effective use of certification budget.<br>
<br>
Tests are performed either by TJS Technical Services Inc. or an accredited third party test house. Unless otherwise indicated, test equipment is calibrated in accordance with ISO 17025.<br>
<br>
Product Safety<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Most manufacturers are all too familiar with the costs and delays which result from surprises during the evaluation, design modifications and subsequent retesting. Some certification agencies offer limited technical advice but typically are unable to provide support from concept phase through to end of life. The Certification Agency high hourly rates also tend to discourage use of the service.<br>
<br>
TJS Technical Services Inc. will provide an knowledgeable and independent customized service to address your needs and to complement in-house resources to help minimize cost and effort. Examples of how we do this are as follows:<br>
<br>
- Work with your team and provide consulting advice as required<br>
- Review designs to identify issues and to help provide solutions<br>
- Perform minimal set of key tests on prototypes to reduce risk of failure during formal tests<br>
<br>
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<br>
To minimize risk of EMC non-compliance, we will review your current design, and coordinate testing at a quality test house for a minimal set of evaluation tests. The test objective is to cost-effectively identify potential issues prior to paying for the full suite of formal tests.<br>
<br>
Custom Test Requirements<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
Product Related Tests<br>
<br>
Examples of the tests that we perform are provided below.<br>
<br>
- Heating Tests: Conduct temperature/heating measurements on products either using thermocouples or infrared (non-contact) technology.<br>
- Leakage Current: Standard burn hazard and electric shock tests.<br>
- Electric Strength Tests (Hipot): High voltage electric strength and insulation strength tests up to 5kV (pre-compliance or small volume production)<br>
- Insulation Resistance Tests (Megger): High voltage insulation resistance tests up to  10 Gohm<br>
<br>
General Electrical Tests<br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
Contact us regarding your custom test needs.<br>
<br>
Facility Related Tests<br>
---------------------<br>
    <br>
- ESD Workstation Tests (ANSI/ESD S4.1): Verification of effectiveness of workstation ESD surfaces through resistance measurement in accordance with the ANSI standard S4.1.<br>
- Telecommunications/Computer Room Power Noise and Grounding: Wiring (neutral and grounding) issues in power systems can result in both safety and noise issues that can impact computer and communications equipment. We perform a series of tests to determine if there are wiring, grounding and ratings (voltage/current) concerns.
