                            None of us recognizes every obstacle we face and we dont always see how we could improve. Our team of coaches have been there, too, and we want to help you excel.<br>
<br>
Executive Coaching gives you a thinking partner - we work outside your day-to-day work and you can speak freely and confidentially with us. We will challenge your assumptions and support you to reach new levels, giving you an enormous opportunity to be even more successful. Coaching delivers leaps in awareness that open up new possibilities in dramatic ways for people. When leaders are able to let go of restrictive ways of seeing themselves and the world, they discover more authentic, creative; and resourceful ways of achieving fulfilling lives and vibrant workplaces.<br>
<br>
As coaches we use our intuition, provide deep active listening; and create awareness by asking intuitive and powerful questions. We will coach you to notice self-perceived limits and become aware of different perspectives, so you can break through your barriers and achieve things you may not have even known you could achieve. And, of course, we hold you accountable throughout the coaching process.<br>
<br>
The best reason to invest in executive coaching for yourself and your organization is to help you achieve your goals and objectives. Thats it. We measure our value by your Return on Investment.  We help you get there with ease and grace, sooner and stronger, and we help you measure the ROI you gain because we are traveling alongside you to help achieve your goals. <br>
<br>
Manchester Inc.s groundbreaking study on the impact of executive coaching shows an average ROI of 5.7 times the initial investment according to executives who estimated the monetary value of the results achieved through coaching.  Padraig Coaching and Consulting often exceeds this threshold. In fact a recent case study of our Accelerating Success program showed an incredible 27 times Return on Investment for our client! <br>

                            Minimizing disruption and maximizing success can be a challenge when a new leader is hired. Our Accelerating Success program helps executives and senior leaders jump into a new role. Our program focuses on getting both the leader and their new team through that difficult transition, quickly, and back to delivering critical success.<br>
<br>
Our emphasis is on the team leader getting to know their team  the individuals,  the issues and the obstacles, along with the team getting to know the leader  the idiosyncrasies that can take months to learn without this program. We use a coach approach to draw out previously unspoken concerns and expectations, then a carefully facilitated workshop to bring it all together. <br>
<br>
Our internationally certified coaches guide the team and the new leader in how to use their new understanding to develop, buy-into, and implement a plan to get over the hurdles and become a high performance team.<br>
<br>
Typically we can accomplish months-worth of adaptation with just a couple hours of preparatory work by the leader and their team, followed by only one day away from the office - delivering enormous return on your investment. Call us to learn more or to arrange for us to help you Accelerate your Success !<br>

                            Many excellent assessment tools exist to measure different things. Youve heard of IQ tests to measure intelligence. Youve maybe heard of Myers-Briggs or DISC to assess personality type. Team members at Padraig Coaching &amp; Consulting Inc. are trained and authorized practitioners of a number of valuable assessment tools for individual and team success.<br>
<br>
DiSC® behaviour profiles provide a common language that people can use to better understand themselves and, most importantly, to understand others and adapt their behaviours with others. This can be within a work team, a sales relationship, a leadership position, or other relationships. DiSC is the leading personal assessment tool used with more than 40 million people to improve work productivity, teamwork, and communication. DiSC is a non-judgmental way to help people discuss their behavioural differences and adapt to one another.<br>
<br>
Another area where we excel, which is particularly important for leader success, is Emotional Intelligence or EI. You may think it sounds touchy-feely and all about soft-skills but Emotional Intelligence will likely have more influence on your personal <br>
career success, and your organizations success, than any other single measurable factor. EQi 2.0 - the industry leading self-assessment tool and the first scientifically validated Emotional Intelligence (EI) tool in the world. Several of our team members are <br>
certified assessors. We highly recommend this tool for any coaching client who wants to achieve better understanding of how they are seen at the office, and how they want to be seen. <br>
<br>
EQ360 - this tool uses the same format as the EQi 2.0 but this time we ask your boss, your peers, your staff, and others to assess your skills in the EQ360, while you take the EQi 2.0. We then help you interpret the way you see yourself, the way others see you, possible gaps in the two, and most importantly figure out where and how youd like to make changes for even greater success in the workplace and in life.<br>

                            The Five Behaviours Of A Cohesive Team is an assessment-based team-workshop that helps individual members of the team, as well as the organization, reveal what it takes to build a truly cohesive and effective team in the most approachable, competent, and effective way possible. <br>
<br>
The program is designed exclusively for intact teams and work groups. The program helps teams understand how, as a team, they score on the key components of Patrick Lencioni&#39;s Five Dysfunctions of a Team model: trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results. <br>
<br>
Each individual on the team will also understand their own personality style and their team members styles, based on the Everything DiSC® model and how their style contributes to the teams overall success.<br>
<br>
The Five Behaviours Model is used to help team members learn to work together more  efficiently and become a more cohesive, productive, high-functioning team that: <br>
<br>
- Makes better, faster decisions<br>
- Taps into the skills, and opinions of all members<br>
- Avoids wasting time and energy on politics, confusion, and destructive conflict<br>
- Avoids wasting time talking about the wrong issues and revisitingthe same topics over and over again because of a lack of buy-in<br>
- Creates a competitive advantage<br>
- Is more fun to be on!<br>

                            What if people had their needs written all over them and you were able to recognize that one person needed more independence, while another the need to participate more with others? What if you could tell if someone was driven by results, or perhaps needs to be challenged, or, maybe their need is to be more collaborative? What if you worked with someone who was just naturally enthusiastic - an approach some called a bit too much while others felt inspired by? Wouldnt it be great if we could recognize these needs and the priorities of those around us and respond appropriately, allowing us to strengthen our relationships with others in a more productive and mutually beneficial way? Would improving your teams ability to communicate with others improve their effectiveness, productivity, morale, or their ability to render better service and increase sales? <br>
<br>
At Padraig, we think so, and we offer a variety of Everything DiSC workshop programs and assessments to boost success for our clients in all of these areas.<br>
<br>
Everything DiSC Workplace profiles and workshop allow everyone in an organization, regardless of title or role, to improve the quality of the workplace and to build better relationships with their colleagues and clients.<br>

                            We see leadership as a one-to-many relationship, rather than the one-to-one relationship found in managing. Everything DiSC Work of Leaders focuses on concrete steps directed at leading an organization or group towards desired outcomes.<br>
<br>
The Work of Leaders program incorporates the standard DiSC profile, plus it stimulates fresh insight and dialog around leadership styles regardless of the leaders knowledge or experience. Its an opportunity for leaders at all levels of learning to reflect on how they approach each part of their work. In addition, Work of Leaders encourages reflection and discussion at a team and organizational level.<br>
<br>
Based on best practices from hundreds of organizations, Work of Leaders connects with the leadership team about real-world demands, generating powerful conversations that provide a clear path for action. Everything DiSC Work of Leaders focuses on tangible steps directed at leading a group or organization toward desired outcomes.<br>
<br>
Using the framework of Vision, Alignment, and Execution, Work of Leaders encourages leaders to understand their own leadership behaviours and how those behaviours affect their effectiveness. The Padraig Team adds depth to the data and depth of experience to support the learning process around key messages.<br>

                            Everything DiSC Sales takes everything that is offered in Everything DiSC Workplace and adds in a fantastic component for sales people - helping them to read profile types in the behaviours of their clients and prospective clients, and how to use that knowledge to adapt their own style to better suit the client or prospect. This increases their chance of concluding a sale and building a solid ongoing sales relationship. <br>
<br>
Everything DiSC Sales helps even the most experienced sales people understand how to better match their style to their customer and potential customers style. <br>
<br>
Participants come to understand and appreciate their own behaviour style and the styles of the people with whom they work. The result is more effective and productive sales teams.<br>
<br>
The Everything DiSC Sales profile and workshop also bring tremendous value to sales people who have different titles: Fundraiser, Negotiator, and Entrepreneur, for example!<br>

                            None of us recognizes every obstacle we face and we dont always see how we could improve. Our team of coaches have been there, too, and we want to help you excel.<br>
<br>
Executive Coaching gives you a thinking partner - we work outside your day-to-day work and you can speak freely and confidentially with us. We will challenge your assumptions and support you to reach new levels, giving you an enormous opportunity to be even more successful. Coaching delivers leaps in awareness that open up new possibilities in dramatic ways for people. When leaders are able to let go of restrictive ways of seeing themselves and the world, they discover more authentic, creative; and resourceful ways of achieving fulfilling lives and vibrant workplaces.<br>
<br>
As coaches we use our intuition, provide deep active listening; and create awareness by asking intuitive and powerful questions. We will coach you to notice self-perceived limits and become aware of different perspectives, so you can break through your barriers and achieve things you may not have even known you could achieve. And, of course, we hold you accountable throughout the coaching process.<br>
<br>
The best reason to invest in executive coaching for yourself and your organization is to help you achieve your goals and objectives. Thats it. We measure our value by your Return on Investment.  We help you get there with ease and grace, sooner and stronger, and we help you measure the ROI you gain because we are traveling alongside you to help achieve your goals. <br>
<br>
Manchester Inc.s groundbreaking study on the impact of executive coaching shows an average ROI of 5.7 times the initial investment according to executives who estimated the monetary value of the results achieved through coaching.  Padraig Coaching and Consulting often exceeds this threshold. In fact a recent case study of our Accelerating Success program showed an incredible 27 times Return on Investment for our client! <br>

                            Minimizing disruption and maximizing success can be a challenge when a new leader is hired. Our Accelerating Success program helps executives and senior leaders jump into a new role. Our program focuses on getting both the leader and their new team through that difficult transition, quickly, and back to delivering critical success.<br>
<br>
Our emphasis is on the team leader getting to know their team  the individuals,  the issues and the obstacles, along with the team getting to know the leader  the idiosyncrasies that can take months to learn without this program. We use a coach approach to draw out previously unspoken concerns and expectations, then a carefully facilitated workshop to bring it all together. <br>
<br>
Our internationally certified coaches guide the team and the new leader in how to use their new understanding to develop, buy-into, and implement a plan to get over the hurdles and become a high performance team.<br>
<br>
Typically we can accomplish months-worth of adaptation with just a couple hours of preparatory work by the leader and their team, followed by only one day away from the office - delivering enormous return on your investment. Call us to learn more or to arrange for us to help you Accelerate your Success !<br>

                            Many excellent assessment tools exist to measure different things. Youve heard of IQ tests to measure intelligence. Youve maybe heard of Myers-Briggs or DISC to assess personality type. Team members at Padraig Coaching &amp; Consulting Inc. are trained and authorized practitioners of a number of valuable assessment tools for individual and team success.<br>
<br>
DiSC® behaviour profiles provide a common language that people can use to better understand themselves and, most importantly, to understand others and adapt their behaviours with others. This can be within a work team, a sales relationship, a leadership position, or other relationships. DiSC is the leading personal assessment tool used with more than 40 million people to improve work productivity, teamwork, and communication. DiSC is a non-judgmental way to help people discuss their behavioural differences and adapt to one another.<br>
<br>
Another area where we excel, which is particularly important for leader success, is Emotional Intelligence or EI. You may think it sounds touchy-feely and all about soft-skills but Emotional Intelligence will likely have more influence on your personal <br>
career success, and your organizations success, than any other single measurable factor. EQi 2.0 - the industry leading self-assessment tool and the first scientifically validated Emotional Intelligence (EI) tool in the world. Several of our team members are <br>
certified assessors. We highly recommend this tool for any coaching client who wants to achieve better understanding of how they are seen at the office, and how they want to be seen. <br>
<br>
EQ360 - this tool uses the same format as the EQi 2.0 but this time we ask your boss, your peers, your staff, and others to assess your skills in the EQ360, while you take the EQi 2.0. We then help you interpret the way you see yourself, the way others see you, possible gaps in the two, and most importantly figure out where and how youd like to make changes for even greater success in the workplace and in life.<br>

                            The Five Behaviours Of A Cohesive Team is an assessment-based team-workshop that helps individual members of the team, as well as the organization, reveal what it takes to build a truly cohesive and effective team in the most approachable, competent, and effective way possible. <br>
<br>
The program is designed exclusively for intact teams and work groups. The program helps teams understand how, as a team, they score on the key components of Patrick Lencioni&#39;s Five Dysfunctions of a Team model: trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results. <br>
<br>
Each individual on the team will also understand their own personality style and their team members styles, based on the Everything DiSC® model and how their style contributes to the teams overall success.<br>
<br>
The Five Behaviours Model is used to help team members learn to work together more  efficiently and become a more cohesive, productive, high-functioning team that: <br>
<br>
- Makes better, faster decisions<br>
- Taps into the skills, and opinions of all members<br>
- Avoids wasting time and energy on politics, confusion, and destructive conflict<br>
- Avoids wasting time talking about the wrong issues and revisitingthe same topics over and over again because of a lack of buy-in<br>
- Creates a competitive advantage<br>
- Is more fun to be on!<br>

                            What if people had their needs written all over them and you were able to recognize that one person needed more independence, while another the need to participate more with others? What if you could tell if someone was driven by results, or perhaps needs to be challenged, or, maybe their need is to be more collaborative? What if you worked with someone who was just naturally enthusiastic - an approach some called a bit too much while others felt inspired by? Wouldnt it be great if we could recognize these needs and the priorities of those around us and respond appropriately, allowing us to strengthen our relationships with others in a more productive and mutually beneficial way? Would improving your teams ability to communicate with others improve their effectiveness, productivity, morale, or their ability to render better service and increase sales? <br>
<br>
At Padraig, we think so, and we offer a variety of Everything DiSC workshop programs and assessments to boost success for our clients in all of these areas.<br>
<br>
Everything DiSC Workplace profiles and workshop allow everyone in an organization, regardless of title or role, to improve the quality of the workplace and to build better relationships with their colleagues and clients.<br>

                            We see leadership as a one-to-many relationship, rather than the one-to-one relationship found in managing. Everything DiSC Work of Leaders focuses on concrete steps directed at leading an organization or group towards desired outcomes.<br>
<br>
The Work of Leaders program incorporates the standard DiSC profile, plus it stimulates fresh insight and dialog around leadership styles regardless of the leaders knowledge or experience. Its an opportunity for leaders at all levels of learning to reflect on how they approach each part of their work. In addition, Work of Leaders encourages reflection and discussion at a team and organizational level.<br>
<br>
Based on best practices from hundreds of organizations, Work of Leaders connects with the leadership team about real-world demands, generating powerful conversations that provide a clear path for action. Everything DiSC Work of Leaders focuses on tangible steps directed at leading a group or organization toward desired outcomes.<br>
<br>
Using the framework of Vision, Alignment, and Execution, Work of Leaders encourages leaders to understand their own leadership behaviours and how those behaviours affect their effectiveness. The Padraig Team adds depth to the data and depth of experience to support the learning process around key messages.<br>

                            Everything DiSC Sales takes everything that is offered in Everything DiSC Workplace and adds in a fantastic component for sales people - helping them to read profile types in the behaviours of their clients and prospective clients, and how to use that knowledge to adapt their own style to better suit the client or prospect. This increases their chance of concluding a sale and building a solid ongoing sales relationship. <br>
<br>
Everything DiSC Sales helps even the most experienced sales people understand how to better match their style to their customer and potential customers style. <br>
<br>
Participants come to understand and appreciate their own behaviour style and the styles of the people with whom they work. The result is more effective and productive sales teams.<br>
<br>
The Everything DiSC Sales profile and workshop also bring tremendous value to sales people who have different titles: Fundraiser, Negotiator, and Entrepreneur, for example!<br>
