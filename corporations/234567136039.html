                            Migrating to a new system causes many stresses in an organization for staff and management alike. Good planning and strong project management can minimize the stress levels and constructively steer the change management process. Communication is of the utmost importance to the management of a project. All those involved in the process must know and clearly understand what is expected of each person, by a specified date. <br>
Syspro&#39;s project team will prepare the initial project plan and will validate that plan with you. The plan will allow for the successful monitoring and management of the project by incorporating the necessary checks and balances required to achieve results on time. The plan will include a communication plan, a scope statement, a change management plan, key milestones, an escalation plan, a reporting structure and the actual project schedule. This plan will clearly define the scope of work, and will have a project schedule and budget. On acceptance of the project plan proposal Syspro will present the plan in the form of a comprehensive project charter<br>

-	Establishing the detailed requirements <br>

                            Education of your staff is vital to the success of every implementation and forms the foundation on which your organization will be able to maximize the potential benefits of your SYSPRO system. <br>
Syspro offers training both during and after the initial implementation and there are different ways that users can be trained depending on your requirements and the scale of your organization. Our recommended approach would be to train one or more employees as a &quot;super&quot; user(s) in their functional area who then train and support other staff internally incorporating your specific processes that end user must know in order to fulfill their job role. However, additional training by Syspro Business Solutions is always available if and when required upon request. <br>

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              The Company<br>
Basic Grain Products Inc. is a leading private-label food manufacturer of snack products including rice cakes, rice crisps, pita chips, soy crisps and potato crisps, sold primarily in the United States and Canada. Basic Grain Product&#39;s corporate office is located in Burnaby, British Columbia, and the company&#39;s manufacturing facility is housed in Coldwater, Ohio.<br>
<br>
The Challenge<br>
Prior to July 2012, Basic Grain Products ran its business on a mixture of different products. Norman Shung, CFO of the company, says: We used ACCPAC for order entry, invoicing and general ledger; Excel for inventory management, production planning, and logistics; and a third-party non-integrated EDI system. <br>
<br>
The main problem with running the business on a non-integrated system was that our data was stored in multiple places, which impaired our ability to make timely decisions.  Nothing was at our fingertips  when we wanted to know specifics it was very painful to get the information, and it was especially difficult to generate reports. To know how many cases of a particular product were available, we had to request a cycle count every time, because our inventory wasnt in a perpetual system. Our business systems were not perpetual, not live, and not up-to-date.<br>
<br>
The Solution<br>
On July 1, 2012, Basic Grain Products implemented SYSPRO, effectively integrating all of its business functions into one system, streamlining processes, and generating real-time information across the entire organization. <br>
<br>
According to Shung, the SYSPRO implementation process went very smoothly, with no major glitches or business interruptions. The real challenges we faced came after the implementation. As is often the case, people are fearful of change, and with SYSPRO came many changes to both our technology and our business processes. It wasn&#39;t long, however, before our employees began to realize how easy it is to access the information they require from SYSPRO. Watching that processes evolve has been inspiring.<br>
<br>
The Result<br>
One of the most important advantages that SYSPRO brought to Basic Grain Products was a Perpetual Inventory system. By connecting the inventory system with Order Entry, says Shung, and by continuously updating information on inventory quantity and availability as a function of doing business, our book inventory now gives us an exact image of our real inventory. That gives us a very high degree of control over our inventory, and over its associated costs. It also helps us keep track of our expired product, and makes it much easier to adhere to the FIFO (first in  first out) method, which wasn&#39;t being properly managed before. We still have to gather more data, but at least, now, the visibility is there.<br>
<br>
Shung is quick to point out that the benefits of SYSPRO&#39;s Lot Traceability module are crucial for a food manufacturer. With Lot Traceability, we know exactly which lots were shipped to each customer, and our warehouse employees can fulfill orders from cases that are not in danger of being outdated. In addition, thanks to SYSPRO, we can now do a mock recall in less than 30 minutes. Before SYSPRO, pulling and qualifying the information took hours  it was a mountain of paperwork. <br>
<br>
Before the implementation, says Shung, no one at Basic Grain Products had a proper understanding of production costing. Our Bill of Materials and Job Costing used to be manual processes, and we didn&#39;t even know our true costs of production. Now, with SYSPRO, we are able to assign more accurate production and overhead costs. Because of that, we&#39;ve learned that we have better margins than we had previously thought.<br>
<br>
SYSPRO Workflow has allowed Basic Grain Products to implement automated order processing through EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). We are now on EDI for customer purchase orders and invoices, says Shung. Our inbound customers&#39; purchase orders are going through EDI, and we invoice back to the customer through EDI. By automating those functions, we&#39;ve eliminated a good deal of manual entry. Our customer service clerk is now only validating the information, which has improved our accuracy and saved a tremendous amount of time.<br>

Quite frankly, the information we get from SYSPRO is priceless.

                            Migrating to a new system causes many stresses in an organization for staff and management alike. Good planning and strong project management can minimize the stress levels and constructively steer the change management process. Communication is of the utmost importance to the management of a project. All those involved in the process must know and clearly understand what is expected of each person, by a specified date. <br>
Syspro&#39;s project team will prepare the initial project plan and will validate that plan with you. The plan will allow for the successful monitoring and management of the project by incorporating the necessary checks and balances required to achieve results on time. The plan will include a communication plan, a scope statement, a change management plan, key milestones, an escalation plan, a reporting structure and the actual project schedule. This plan will clearly define the scope of work, and will have a project schedule and budget. On acceptance of the project plan proposal Syspro will present the plan in the form of a comprehensive project charter<br>

                            Education of your staff is vital to the success of every implementation and forms the foundation on which your organization will be able to maximize the potential benefits of your SYSPRO system. <br>
Syspro offers training both during and after the initial implementation and there are different ways that users can be trained depending on your requirements and the scale of your organization. Our recommended approach would be to train one or more employees as a &quot;super&quot; user(s) in their functional area who then train and support other staff internally incorporating your specific processes that end user must know in order to fulfill their job role. However, additional training by Syspro Business Solutions is always available if and when required upon request. <br>

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              The Company<br>
Basic Grain Products Inc. is a leading private-label food manufacturer of snack products including rice cakes, rice crisps, pita chips, soy crisps and potato crisps, sold primarily in the United States and Canada. Basic Grain Product&#39;s corporate office is located in Burnaby, British Columbia, and the company&#39;s manufacturing facility is housed in Coldwater, Ohio.<br>
<br>
The Challenge<br>
Prior to July 2012, Basic Grain Products ran its business on a mixture of different products. Norman Shung, CFO of the company, says: We used ACCPAC for order entry, invoicing and general ledger; Excel for inventory management, production planning, and logistics; and a third-party non-integrated EDI system. <br>
<br>
The main problem with running the business on a non-integrated system was that our data was stored in multiple places, which impaired our ability to make timely decisions.  Nothing was at our fingertips  when we wanted to know specifics it was very painful to get the information, and it was especially difficult to generate reports. To know how many cases of a particular product were available, we had to request a cycle count every time, because our inventory wasnt in a perpetual system. Our business systems were not perpetual, not live, and not up-to-date.<br>
<br>
The Solution<br>
On July 1, 2012, Basic Grain Products implemented SYSPRO, effectively integrating all of its business functions into one system, streamlining processes, and generating real-time information across the entire organization. <br>
<br>
According to Shung, the SYSPRO implementation process went very smoothly, with no major glitches or business interruptions. The real challenges we faced came after the implementation. As is often the case, people are fearful of change, and with SYSPRO came many changes to both our technology and our business processes. It wasn&#39;t long, however, before our employees began to realize how easy it is to access the information they require from SYSPRO. Watching that processes evolve has been inspiring.<br>
<br>
The Result<br>
One of the most important advantages that SYSPRO brought to Basic Grain Products was a Perpetual Inventory system. By connecting the inventory system with Order Entry, says Shung, and by continuously updating information on inventory quantity and availability as a function of doing business, our book inventory now gives us an exact image of our real inventory. That gives us a very high degree of control over our inventory, and over its associated costs. It also helps us keep track of our expired product, and makes it much easier to adhere to the FIFO (first in  first out) method, which wasn&#39;t being properly managed before. We still have to gather more data, but at least, now, the visibility is there.<br>

Shung is quick to point out that the benefits of SYSPRO&#39;s Lot Traceability module are crucial for a food manufacturer. With Lot Traceability, we know exactly which lots were shipped to each customer, and our warehouse employees can fulfill orders from cases that are not in danger of being outdated. In addition, thanks to SYSPRO, we can now do a mock recall in less than 30 minutes. Before SYSPRO, pulling and qualifying the information took hours  it was a mountain of paperwork. <br>
<br>
Before the implementation, says Shung, no one at Basic Grain Products had a proper understanding of production costing. Our Bill of Materials and Job Costing used to be manual processes, and we didn&#39;t even know our true costs of production. Now, with SYSPRO, we are able to assign more accurate production and overhead costs. Because of that, we&#39;ve learned that we have better margins than we had previously thought.<br>
<br>
SYSPRO Workflow has allowed Basic Grain Products to implement automated order processing through EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). We are now on EDI for customer purchase orders and invoices, says Shung. Our inbound customers&#39; purchase orders are going through EDI, and we invoice back to the customer through EDI. By automating those functions, we&#39;ve eliminated a good deal of manual entry. Our customer service clerk is now only validating the information, which has improved our accuracy and saved a tremendous amount of time.<br>
<br>
Asked if he can calculate the ROI for SYSPRO ERP, Shung has no reservations. SYSPRO has provided us with a rapid ROI, he affirms, but I couldn&#39;t begin to quantify it. Quite frankly, the information we get from SYSPRO is priceless.
