              VoiceMailTel phone service has worked great for us! We can even have our receptionist answer at the office and transfer the calls to us in the field - as if we were right down the hall! We have received so many compliments on the auto attendant feature - we have even referred 4 customers! Thanks, VoiceMailTel!<br>

We switched to VoiceMailTel from [another provider], and for all of the right reasons. Great customer service, awesome features, and no hidden fees. Keep up the great work!<br>

VoiceMailTel helped us give a great impression to our customers - instead of having an unprofessional looking cell phone number on our homepage we can have a virtual PBX system, with both local and toll free number. The call forward feature is great for us, since a lot of our business is done from home or on the road. Overall, it&#39;s a great product with a ton of awesome features that has significantly improved the way we do business.<br>

Greetings! My name is Maria Grand, I handle PR in a small Real Estate business that started working with your system not long ago. I am writing you to express our gratitude and satisfaction towards your services. When at first I presented your offer to my boss, he was little confident, but reviewing your rates he gave me permission to use your 30 Days Free Trial. We have few employees in the company, but all of us are constantly on the move and the communication within the company or even with the costumers was a bit scarce and chaotic. Now that we have your virtual phone service we can maintain a perfect contact between each other and with our customers and partners, too. Costs have decreased and our company is evolving much faster. Our partners said they will choose your service as well. So thank you for the services you provided us!<br>

We are a small healthcare company taking care of the people from our area. As a good communication between us and the patients is vital, VoiceMailTel helped us a lot. We not only pay much less than we used to, but we have a Virtual Office that permits us to be mobile and still take any calls. It&#39;s a great service, we are very satisfied.<br>

When we started our company we thought succeeding in the field of publishing and distributing Mathematics&#39; merchandising was almost an impossible aim with all the costs involved and above all, with such a strong competition. We are 3 partners, always on the move, always in hurry and always trying to find new ways of advertising our company. We found out about VoiceMailTel&#39;s service and we thought we should give it a try. I can tell you now we have a great image, like the ones big companies have, that instantly increased our sales and our clients&#39; trust in us. We have a greater liberty of move now as our clients can reach us anywhere and anytime as we enabled our calls to be redirected on our mobile phones and as we have virtual extensions, our clients can reach any of us, without waiting anymore. A great improvement for our company: a cost-effective solution that gave us a break in the business.<br>

Being a small business dealing with large clients, VoiceMailTel offered us the possibility to &quot;stay up&quot; with the competition and now our company is at the same level of communication with the big companies. And the best thing is that we are paying a small fraction from what they are paying for the same services. We declare ourselves a satisfied VoiceMailTel client, we will recommend your service to our friends and partners, for sure.<br>

I am a young floral shop-owner, and client of VoiceMailTel. Your service helped me out a lot; now in stead of unprofessionally listing my cell phone number on my website, I have a Toll Free which increases my chances of getting new clients. One of my friends was amazed by it, he didn&#39;t believe I was the man behind this business, and when I told him about the costs, he was simply shocked. I am paying a small fraction of what big companies are and still have an appearance like theirs. Thanks, VoiceMailTel.<br>

My name is Albert Robinson. Recently I&#39;ve started my own floral small home-based business. At start I must be very careful with my expenses so I had to search for a more cost-convenient communication method, so I found out about your service. The features that convinced me were the no hardware/software installation and the big business image given by your service. Now I have a great image in front of my customers, inspiring professionalism and trust in my company, and all this at low costs, which is making my business grow faster and faster.<br>

VoiceMailTel is a NOT TO MISS service! I have tried several services before but either the quality wasn&#39;t reliable, or the rates were literally closing down my small business. I found out about VoiceMailTel from a fellow notary who&#39;s working with your service. I called him and I was welcomed by such a professional greeting that I thought he expanded his office overnight. To tell you the truth the customized greeting almost convinced me to chose his services, haha, but in stead I chose VoiceMailTel&#39;s and now I am so satisfied I did it that the smallest thing to do in exchange was to write this testimonial. Now I have such a professional image that clients are more and more every day and the best thing is that me and my 3 employees can handle all calls thanks to the Virtual Extensions, and the best thing is now I can give my callers more information about my services without loosing any time and without they spending anything on the call. Thanks, VoiceMailTel!<br>

As a manufacturing company, our products&#39; number is always increasing and we try to have special offers all the time, but until now advertising them was a huge financial effort from our side. With VoiceMailTel&#39;s service now we have a targeted advertising campaign directly on our phone system and the best thing about it it&#39;s that costs have incredibly diminished, so the company is growing faster and sales are better and better. <br>

We are a home-based casting company providing actors for movies, TV shows and commercials. People do usually call before applying their resumes, so the number of calls exceeds our possibilities to answer. We started working with VoiceMailTel not long time ago, but I can tell you we are very satisfied now. Not only clients and actors have a better, more powerful image of our business, but the best thing is now we can answer all calls without the need to stay near our home-phone as it was until now. Business is doing great, and we are much more productive. Thanks!<br>

I have a small management company taking care of several music groups. Until now I had some problems satisfying all their needs with calling everyone from organizers to producers, from possible sponsors to music magazines. The costs were enormous and I had serious doubts weather I should continue or not, but I found out about your services from a friend and gave it a try, although I was not confident enough. At first I was pleasantly surprised of your small rates, and now, after 3 months of working with your Virtual Office, I can handle it all: using my Toll Free number anyone can call me and have no costs, thanks to the Call Transfer feature I am no longer tied to the office and also the Calling Card helps me a lot to call from everywhere I am. And I should not forget about the small rates. I am glad I chose your service.<br>

              VoiceMailTel phone service has worked great for us! We can even have our receptionist answer at the office and transfer the calls to us in the field - as if we were right down the hall! We have received so many compliments on the auto attendant feature - we have even referred 4 customers! Thanks, VoiceMailTel!<br>

VoiceMailTel helped us give a great impression to our customers - instead of having an unprofessional looking cell phone number on our homepage we can have a virtual PBX system, with both local and toll free number. The call forward feature is great for us, since a lot of our business is done from home or on the road. Overall, it&#39;s a great product with a ton of awesome features that has significantly improved the way we do business.<br>

Greetings! My name is Maria Grand, I handle PR in a small Real Estate business that started working with your system not long ago. I am writing you to express our gratitude and satisfaction towards your services. When at first I presented your offer to my boss, he was little confident, but reviewing your rates he gave me permission to use your 30 Days Free Trial. We have few employees in the company, but all of us are constantly on the move and the communication within the company or even with the costumers was a bit scarce and chaotic. Now that we have your virtual phone service we can maintain a perfect contact between each other and with our customers and partners, too. Costs have decreased and our company is evolving much faster. Our partners said they will choose your service as well. So thank you for the services you provided us!<br>

We are a small healthcare company taking care of the people from our area. As a good communication between us and the patients is vital, VoiceMailTel helped us a lot. We not only pay much less than we used to, but we have a Virtual Office that permits us to be mobile and still take any calls. It&#39;s a great service, we are very satisfied.<br>

When we started our company we thought succeeding in the field of publishing and distributing Mathematics&#39; merchandising was almost an impossible aim with all the costs involved and above all, with such a strong competition. We are 3 partners, always on the move, always in hurry and always trying to find new ways of advertising our company. We found out about VoiceMailTel&#39;s service and we thought we should give it a try. I can tell you now we have a great image, like the ones big companies have, that instantly increased our sales and our clients&#39; trust in us. We have a greater liberty of move now as our clients can reach us anywhere and anytime as we enabled our calls to be redirected on our mobile phones and as we have virtual extensions, our clients can reach any of us, without waiting anymore. A great improvement for our company: a cost-effective solution that gave us a break in the business.<br>

Being a small business dealing with large clients, VoiceMailTel offered us the possibility to &quot;stay up&quot; with the competition and now our company is at the same level of communication with the big companies. And the best thing is that we are paying a small fraction from what they are paying for the same services. We declare ourselves a satisfied VoiceMailTel client, we will recommend your service to our friends and partners, for sure.<br>

I am a young floral shop-owner, and client of VoiceMailTel. Your service helped me out a lot; now in stead of unprofessionally listing my cell phone number on my website, I have a Toll Free which increases my chances of getting new clients. One of my friends was amazed by it, he didn&#39;t believe I was the man behind this business, and when I told him about the costs, he was simply shocked. I am paying a small fraction of what big companies are and still have an appearance like theirs. Thanks, VoiceMailTel.<br>

My name is Albert Robinson. Recently I&#39;ve started my own floral small home-based business. At start I must be very careful with my expenses so I had to search for a more cost-convenient communication method, so I found out about your service. The features that convinced me were the no hardware/software installation and the big business image given by your service. Now I have a great image in front of my customers, inspiring professionalism and trust in my company, and all this at low costs, which is making my business grow faster and faster.<br>

VoiceMailTel is a NOT TO MISS service! I have tried several services before but either the quality wasn&#39;t reliable, or the rates were literally closing down my small business. I found out about VoiceMailTel from a fellow notary who&#39;s working with your service. I called him and I was welcomed by such a professional greeting that I thought he expanded his office overnight. To tell you the truth the customized greeting almost convinced me to chose his services, haha, but in stead I chose VoiceMailTel&#39;s and now I am so satisfied I did it that the smallest thing to do in exchange was to write this testimonial. Now I have such a professional image that clients are more and more every day and the best thing is that me and my 3 employees can handle all calls thanks to the Virtual Extensions, and the best thing is now I can give my callers more information about my services without loosing any time and without they spending anything on the call. Thanks, VoiceMailTel!<br>

As a manufacturing company, our products&#39; number is always increasing and we try to have special offers all the time, but until now advertising them was a huge financial effort from our side. With VoiceMailTel&#39;s service now we have a targeted advertising campaign directly on our phone system and the best thing about it it&#39;s that costs have incredibly diminished, so the company is growing faster and sales are better and better. <br>

We are a home-based casting company providing actors for movies, TV shows and commercials. People do usually call before applying their resumes, so the number of calls exceeds our possibilities to answer. We started working with VoiceMailTel not long time ago, but I can tell you we are very satisfied now. Not only clients and actors have a better, more powerful image of our business, but the best thing is now we can answer all calls without the need to stay near our home-phone as it was until now. Business is doing great, and we are much more productive. Thanks!<br>

I have a small management company taking care of several music groups. Until now I had some problems satisfying all their needs with calling everyone from organizers to producers, from possible sponsors to music magazines. The costs were enormous and I had serious doubts weather I should continue or not, but I found out about your services from a friend and gave it a try, although I was not confident enough. At first I was pleasantly surprised of your small rates, and now, after 3 months of working with your Virtual Office, I can handle it all: using my Toll Free number anyone can call me and have no costs, thanks to the Call Transfer feature I am no longer tied to the office and also the Calling Card helps me a lot to call from everywhere I am. And I should not forget about the small rates. I am glad I chose your service.<br>
