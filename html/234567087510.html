It is now moving towards its fourth season of hosting top quality outdoor concerts featuring our First Nations Professional Musicians and Youth from our communities; Juno and Grammy Award winning artists of native and non-native descent also have graced the stage.  The Tiny Cabin is nestled along what used to be called Mohawk Bay.  It is located just a stone throw from the heritage site for the landing of the Mohawks in 1784. The Landing is an annual commemoration of the historic arrival of the Mohawks here on May 22, 1784, although archival cartographic maps show Iroquois settlement on the north shore of Lake Ontario more than 150 years prior.<br><br>Celebrated since 1929, &quot;Mohawk Landing&quot; is held on the Sunday closest to May 22.. Traditional dress and Iroquoian food also enhance this unique historical celebration. Tyendinaga, when translated in English, means &quot;where the wood comes together.&quot; Of special significance, the name is derived from &quot; Thayentiné:ka,&quot; Captain Joseph Brant&#39;s Mohawk  name and reflects the belief that &quot;our strength shall be in unity.&quot;  David R. Maracle is the owner of this breathtaking property, and his wife Kimberly helps to manage the property and oversees and executes all business contracts, and scheduling. <br><br><br> <br><br><br>MOHAWK HERITAGE &amp; CULTURAL DESTINATION<br>THE ROYAL TOUCH<br> <br>Make your way to the Gothic-style Christ Church, Her Majesty&#39;s Royal Chapel of the Mohawks, on South Church Road, just above Bayshore Road, AROUND THE CORNER FROM LIL CROW CAFÉ to see one of only six &quot;Chapels Royal&quot; outside the United Kingdom. Now designated a National Historical Site, the stone Church was built by the Mohawks in 1843 to replace a log structure built soon after 1784 landing of the first arrivals.<br>The Church is filled with Royal Gifts, testament to the long association of the Mohawks with the British Crown. On display is a triptych in the Mohawk language given by King George III, a Royal coat of arms given by King George V, a Bible presented by Queen Victoria. <br>The Church&#39;s most historic artefact-used only on ceremonial occasions-is the treasured Communion Silver set given by Queen Anne in 1711 as a symbol of Mohawk and British alliance. <br><br><br><br>DAVID R. MARACLE AND THE VISION<br><br>David R. Maracle, Bear Clan, named Tehenneiakwa;tarons (cutter of stone)  has lived on this historical land for over 35 years and finally settled on the waterfront and has called it home for 20 years; a gift from his Father Karoniaktatjeh.  Davids heart has always been about First Nations Rights, Culture and Language; being able to convey teachings through his carvings of stone and his musical abilities has been his lifetime goal and achievement.  <br><br>David in recent years, had a vision about the land  he wanted to build a stage for First Nations Musicians and Artists who are in the business, to provide a place to perform in between Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto.  David felt it was time that a place be created and dedicated to First Nations Musicians and youth who were interested in the Music and Arts path.   David has used all of his savings and his personal funds to take on this project by himself, with no help from grants or sponsors to date. David is a professional Musician himself, having 14 albums to his credit.  He is also a World Renown First Nations Sculptor and knows first hand the importance of guidance and encouragement for the Youth who grow up in his community of Tyendinaga. <br><br>He thoroughly believes that if the Youth have a place to be encouraged and groomed in the Culture, the Language, Music, and Arts, the Youth will have a better chance in staying on a good road of health and happiness for generations to come.  During Davids youth, he had a very strong mentor in his father, who always encouraged him in his artistic path and accredits his Father and Mother for the support he needed to achieve his goals.<br> <br>David feels by giving back to the community and the youth, he has completed that circle of life that he was taught to respect. Native Expressions and Stage Red Performance Courtyard is a tribute stage for the youth. This is a place for the youth to come and showcase themselves, a healthy environment for them to be encouraged by fellow First Nations Musicians and Artists, in front of their whole community who come out to support them.  What better way to instill pride and dignity to our First Nations Youth; BY EXAMPLE.<br><br>The stage has also been extended to the other colors of our medicine wheel to make it a multi-cultural venue with a First Nations organic ambiance.  It is truly a magical, organic place, where the Traditional knowledge, Culture, Music and Arts unfold on the grounds of this beautiful courtyard. David and Kimberly wanted to share this wonderful piece of land with everyone, right in the heart of the Peacemakers Territory, Tyendinaga Mohawk Land....<br><br>

                            David began his career as a carver/sculptor in 1985.  Traveling to Pow Wows, craft shows and fine art shows helped to develop and create a unique lifestyle, which allowed his abilities as a sculptor to soar.  David, now an acclaimed World-Renowned Stone Carver/Sculptor, has received many awards globally for his unique and detailed works of art. His most prestigious award given was at The Heard Museum in Scottsdale, Arizona in 2008.  The influences of his First Nations-Mohawk Heritage are clearly depicted in his sculptures. This has been his main goal; to educate people about the First Nations-Mohawk culture and issues through his artwork.<br>
<br>
His sculptures have touched the hearts of many people; private and corporate collectors alike throughout the world. Some of his more famous Curators include Nelson Mandela, Loretta Lynne, Dan Akroyd, and the Emperor of Japan.  David is well-known for his realism in his carvings of Eagles, Elders &amp; First Nations Heritage symbols.<br>
<br>
A highlight of his carving career - taking 1st prize Blue Ribbon with his one of a kind 3 foot sculpture entitled &quot;Gathering Our Minds&quot; at the Prestigious Scottsdale Arizona &quot;Heard Museum&quot; in 2009.   Davids sculptures have been featured on cheques across Canada at all major banks, and he has had many art installations in High End Galleries all around Canada.

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Many companies, such as the Ontario Power Generation, and the Society of Energy Professionals have utilized our workshops to help in Aboriginal Sensitivity training and Education with their staff members.  We have also been contracted to over 15 schools within the Upper Canada District School Board of Ontario to further educate and sensitize the youth about our Culture, Music and Traditional Teachings.  We have been to as far as Nova Scotia with our teachings in their schools in the province, and have had rave reviews from teachers, parents and students alike.  We can cater to large groups of over 400 people, or intimate sized gatherings of any aged group, and refine the workshop to meet the needs of corporate, government and private companies alike.  
           
            
        
                
     
  
    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;Whether making music or the instrument of music, David R. Maracle puts his imaginative skills to work to produce beauty with excellence in sound and shape.&quot; - Stephen J. Augustine, Curatoro of Ethinology, Canadian Museum of Civilization<br>
<br>
&quot;Im very impressed with your works of art - a definite Canadian Master.&quot; - Gary Slimon, Director, Curatorial Services, The Canadian Wildlife &amp; Wilderness Art Museum<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a certain warmth that occurs while in their presence at Lil Crow Native Art Centre; the gestalt of partnership that gently asks you to step foward and be embraced.  It is then that the magic of what they bring - be it art, comestible nourishment, or sweet music - can be fully realized.&quot;  Astrid Young, Bestselling Author, Recording Artist &amp; Sommolier<br>
<br>
&quot; I would happily debate with anyone that David R. Maracle is one of the world&#39;s most talented modern day carvers, and it is easy to see why he has commissioned works around the world.  Each of his carvings is unique and those who have witnessed David&#39;s talents are amazed at the quality, skill, energy and the time he invests in each piece.&quot; - Harry Willmot, Manager, Aboriginal Market Development, Royal Bank<br>
<br>
&quot;I have known David for many years and he is truly an extraordinary talent.  He has rightfully earned and received both national and international recognition.&quot; - Ron Jamieson, Senior VP, BMO Bank of Montreal<br>
<br>
David has also been a featured artist on cheques across Canada in all major Banks for his artwork series, to help support Advancement of Aboriginal Youth.

                            David began his career as a carver/sculptor in 1985.  Traveling to Pow Wows, craft shows and fine art shows helped to develop and create a unique lifestyle, which allowed his abilities as a sculptor to soar.  David, now an acclaimed World-Renowned Stone Carver/Sculptor, has received many awards globally for his unique and detailed works of art. His most prestigious award given was at The Heard Museum in Scottsdale, Arizona in 2008.  The influences of his First Nations-Mohawk Heritage are clearly depicted in his sculptures. This has been his main goal; to educate people about the First Nations-Mohawk culture and issues through his artwork.<br>
<br>
His sculptures have touched the hearts of many people; private and corporate collectors alike throughout the world. Some of his more famous Curators include Nelson Mandela, Loretta Lynne, Dan Akroyd, and the Emperor of Japan.  David is well-known for his realism in his carvings of Eagles, Elders &amp; First Nations Heritage symbols.<br>
<br>
A highlight of his carving career - taking 1st prize Blue Ribbon with his one of a kind 3 foot sculpture entitled &quot;Gathering Our Minds&quot; at the Prestigious Scottsdale Arizona &quot;Heard Museum&quot; in 2009.   Davids sculptures have been featured on cheques across Canada at all major banks, and he has had many art installations in High End Galleries all around Canada.

                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Many companies, such as the Ontario Power Generation, and the Society of Energy Professionals have utilized our workshops to help in Aboriginal Sensitivity training and Education with their staff members.  We have also been contracted to over 15 schools within the Upper Canada District School Board of Ontario to further educate and sensitize the youth about our Culture, Music and Traditional Teachings.  We have been to as far as Nova Scotia with our teachings in their schools in the province, and have had rave reviews from teachers, parents and students alike.  We can cater to large groups of over 400 people, or intimate sized gatherings of any aged group, and refine the workshop to meet the needs of corporate, government and private companies alike.  
           
            
        
                
     
  
    
      
        
                     
          
          
          
              <h4>
                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              &quot;Whether making music or the instrument of music, David R. Maracle puts his imaginative skills to work to produce beauty with excellence in sound and shape.&quot; - Stephen J. Augustine, Curatoro of Ethinology, Canadian Museum of Civilization<br>
<br>
&quot;Im very impressed with your works of art - a definite Canadian Master.&quot; - Gary Slimon, Director, Curatorial Services, The Canadian Wildlife &amp; Wilderness Art Museum<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a certain warmth that occurs while in their presence at Lil Crow Native Art Centre; the gestalt of partnership that gently asks you to step foward and be embraced.  It is then that the magic of what they bring - be it art, comestible nourishment, or sweet music - can be fully realized.&quot;  Astrid Young, Bestselling Author, Recording Artist &amp; Sommolier<br>
<br>
&quot; I would happily debate with anyone that David R. Maracle is one of the world&#39;s most talented modern day carvers, and it is easy to see why he has commissioned works around the world.  Each of his carvings is unique and those who have witnessed David&#39;s talents are amazed at the quality, skill, energy and the time he invests in each piece.&quot; - Harry Willmot, Manager, Aboriginal Market Development, Royal Bank<br>
<br>
&quot;I have known David for many years and he is truly an extraordinary talent.  He has rightfully earned and received both national and international recognition.&quot; - Ron Jamieson, Senior VP, BMO Bank of Montreal<br>
<br>
David has also been a featured artist on cheques across Canada in all major Banks for his artwork series, to help support Advancement of Aboriginal Youth.
