        <br>            Phase Separation Solutions (PS2) is a North American leader in the treatment of soil, sludge and debris impacted with both chlorinated and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons.  Permitted for the treatment of such compounds as PCB, Dioxin/Furan, Creosote, PAH, PERC and others PS2 utilizes its unique, Canadian developed and internationally proven, non-incineration Thermal Phase Separation (TPS) technology.  Used for such internationally recognized projects as the remediation of the 2000 Olympic Games site in Sydney, Australia the TPS uses safe and secure indirect thermal desorption to remove contaminants from soil.  TPS is the economical and proven green alternative to incineration.<br>

              <h4>
                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Below are only several of the successful Canadian and International Projects for which the TPS technology has been used<br>
<br>
Location:		Japan<br>
Duration:		2002-Ongoing<br>
Contaminant:	PCB, PAH, Cyanide Impacted Soil<br>
<br>
After successful operations in Australia and field testing in Japan, using the TPS Pilot Scale Unit, a TPS unit was purchased by a major Japanese conglomerate for exclusive use in Japan.  After several months of refitting to meet specific Japanese environmental and operational requirements the TPS unit was placed into successful commercial operation.<br>
<br>
Location:		Sydney, Australia<br>
Duration:		1999<br>
Contaminant:	PCDD/PCDF and Organochlorine Compounds<br>
<br>
In 1999 Australian Defence Industries (ADI) was contracted by the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA) to remediate a site adjacent to the 2000 Games Olympic Village contaminated with dioxins/furans and chlorobenzenes.  This site was located on an abandoned pesticides production facility at Homebush Bay in Sydney, Australia.  In keeping with the regulatory goals of the Australian environmental authority and the stated principles of the OCA a comprehensive, non-incineration, on-site solution was demanded.  <br>
<br>
ADI initiated a comprehensive and integrated strategy to both remediate the site in question and destroy, on-site, the collected organochlorine contaminants.  It contracted the TPS, indirect thermal desorption technology after an exhaustive international seach, which effectively extracted the contaminants from the soil while ADIs ADOX/BCD technology destroyed the produced contaminant concentrate using a proprietary chemical dechlorination process.  Both technologies are highly efficient and do not utilize incineration therefore protecting against the hazards associated with high temperature incineration (PIC production and toxic emissions)  and off-site transport. <br>
<br>
The project success was publicly recognized by the Australian branch of Greenpeace and promoted as the preferred method for management of persistent organic pollutants worldwide.<br>
<br>
<br>
Location:		Quebec<br>
Duration:		1997-98<br>
Contaminant:	PCB-Aroclor 1260, PAH, PCP  contaminated    soils, sludges, sediments<br>
<br>
In 1997-98 the TPS was established in Sherbrooke, Quebec for the treatment of PCB and PAH contaminated soils, sludges and sediments received from a number of clients across Canada.  One of the series of projects conducted was the treatment of PCB contaminated soil with a very high percentage of highly plastic clay. This soil averaged 69% clay with 0-80um particle size distribution and an average 23% moisture content. The high clay content makes any treatment process very difficult due to the high surface area and entrapment of hydrocarbons in the pore spaces of the clay particles.  The TPS technology successfully treated this material to a PCB remediation criteria of &lt; 1mg/kg.  <br>
<br>
In addition to this challenging project, the TPS completed treatment and decontamination of a volume of  PCB contaminated soil generated by a Canadian Provincial crown corporation allowing it to complete a major divestiture of assets.  The TPS also treated an additional volume of PCB contaminated soil on behalf of a major Canadian financial institution allowing it to complete a significant real estate transaction.  During this mobilization the TPS also completed a full scale treatability test of PAH and PCB contaminated sludge and sediment from the Sydney Tar Ponds site.  The TPS is the only technology to have undertaken such a study for what is considered the most contaminated site in Canada, containing over 700,000 mT of PCB and PAH contaminated material.<br>
<br>
<br>
Location:			Villano, Ecuador<br>
Duration:			2000-2001/2002-2003<br>
Contaminant:		Synthetic Base Drill Cuttings<br>
<br>
The TPS was contracted to provide thermal treatment services for SBM contaminated drill mud and cuttings and base oil recovery. The drill site located at Block 10 near Villano, Ecuador was, for environmental reasons, a helicopter site.  All equipment, supply and personnel was airlifted in and out.  The TPS equipment was transported in 8,000kg lifts into a site located in one of the most biologically diverse regions of the planet.  In total the TPS successfully treated over 20,000mT of contaminated cuttings with an average 34% TPH producing a benign solid with &lt;0.023%TPH that was used to rehabilitate the site upon completion.  A total of over 4,000bbls of synthetic base oil was recovered and reused throughout the drilling project.  All base oil was recovered totaling over 4000bbls for a cost recovery of over $1.5million.   The TPS was contracted for a second project of a similar nature in 2002 utilizing the recovered synthetic fluid from the first project which was again received by the TPS and placed in storage to await use in follow on drilling.<br>
<br>
Location:			Tengiz, Kazakhstan<br>
Duration:			2001-Ongoing<br>
Contaminant:		Drill Cuttings<br>
<br>
<br>
The TPS was deployed on contract by the Kazakhstan operating arm of ChevronTexaco to provide base oil recovery and treatment of drill muds and cuttings treatment for its Tengiz program in 2001.  Based upon the performance of the initially supplied single 24mT/day TPS unit, the client requested an additional 55 mT/day unit to allow it to decommission its established bio-remediation program in favour of the TPS and accommodate any increase in drilling activity.  The material being treated is often up to 50% liquid by volume and both units consistently exceed rated capacity by up to 20%.  Treated solids consistently meet the treatment criteria.  The recovered oil is recycled and reused and no date for retiring the TPS from the site has been considered.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Location:			Hasi Masood and Burkine,  Algeria<br>
Duration:			2004-Ongoing<br>
Contaminant:		Drill Cuttings and Production Sludge<br>
<br>
In probably its most ambitious deployment to date, three TPS units, including two 100 mT/day units have been deployed to the Western Desert of Algeria as part of a major drilling project.  The units will be on site for a minimum of 5 years providing a total treatment capacity of over 150 mT/day .  This material will consist of weathered petroleum sludges, the remnants of previous drilling projects, active drilling solids and processing sludges all impacted with a minimum of 25% TPH.<br>

              <h4>
                Success stories:
              </h4>
           
              Below are only several of the successful Canadian and International Projects for which the TPS technology has been used<br>
<br>
Location:		Japan<br>
Duration:		2002-Ongoing<br>
Contaminant:	PCB, PAH, Cyanide Impacted Soil<br>
<br>
After successful operations in Australia and field testing in Japan, using the TPS Pilot Scale Unit, a TPS unit was purchased by a major Japanese conglomerate for exclusive use in Japan.  After several months of refitting to meet specific Japanese environmental and operational requirements the TPS unit was placed into successful commercial operation.<br>
<br>
Location:		Sydney, Australia<br>
Duration:		1999<br>
Contaminant:	PCDD/PCDF and Organochlorine Compounds<br>
<br>
In 1999 Australian Defence Industries (ADI) was contracted by the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA) to remediate a site adjacent to the 2000 Games Olympic Village contaminated with dioxins/furans and chlorobenzenes.  This site was located on an abandoned pesticides production facility at Homebush Bay in Sydney, Australia.  In keeping with the regulatory goals of the Australian environmental authority and the stated principles of the OCA a comprehensive, non-incineration, on-site solution was demanded.  <br>
<br>
ADI initiated a comprehensive and integrated strategy to both remediate the site in question and destroy, on-site, the collected organochlorine contaminants.  It contracted the TPS, indirect thermal desorption technology after an exhaustive international seach, which effectively extracted the contaminants from the soil while ADIs ADOX/BCD technology destroyed the produced contaminant concentrate using a proprietary chemical dechlorination process.  Both technologies are highly efficient and do not utilize incineration therefore protecting against the hazards associated with high temperature incineration (PIC production and toxic emissions)  and off-site transport. <br>
<br>
The project success was publicly recognized by the Australian branch of Greenpeace and promoted as the preferred method for management of persistent organic pollutants worldwide.<br>
<br>
<br>
Location:		Quebec<br>
Duration:		1997-98<br>
Contaminant:	PCB-Aroclor 1260, PAH, PCP  contaminated    soils, sludges, sediments<br>
<br>
In 1997-98 the TPS was established in Sherbrooke, Quebec for the treatment of PCB and PAH contaminated soils, sludges and sediments received from a number of clients across Canada.  One of the series of projects conducted was the treatment of PCB contaminated soil with a very high percentage of highly plastic clay. This soil averaged 69% clay with 0-80um particle size distribution and an average 23% moisture content. The high clay content makes any treatment process very difficult due to the high surface area and entrapment of hydrocarbons in the pore spaces of the clay particles.  The TPS technology successfully treated this material to a PCB remediation criteria of &lt; 1mg/kg.  <br>
<br>
In addition to this challenging project, the TPS completed treatment and decontamination of a volume of  PCB contaminated soil generated by a Canadian Provincial crown corporation allowing it to complete a major divestiture of assets.  The TPS also treated an additional volume of PCB contaminated soil on behalf of a major Canadian financial institution allowing it to complete a significant real estate transaction.  During this mobilization the TPS also completed a full scale treatability test of PAH and PCB contaminated sludge and sediment from the Sydney Tar Ponds site.  The TPS is the only technology to have undertaken such a study for what is considered the most contaminated site in Canada, containing over 700,000 mT of PCB and PAH contaminated material.<br>
<br>
<br>
Location:			Villano, Ecuador<br>
Duration:			2000-2001/2002-2003<br>
Contaminant:		Synthetic Base Drill Cuttings<br>
<br>
The TPS was contracted to provide thermal treatment services for SBM contaminated drill mud and cuttings and base oil recovery. The drill site located at Block 10 near Villano, Ecuador was, for environmental reasons, a helicopter site.  All equipment, supply and personnel was airlifted in and out.  The TPS equipment was transported in 8,000kg lifts into a site located in one of the most biologically diverse regions of the planet.  In total the TPS successfully treated over 20,000mT of contaminated cuttings with an average 34% TPH producing a benign solid with &lt;0.023%TPH that was used to rehabilitate the site upon completion.  A total of over 4,000bbls of synthetic base oil was recovered and reused throughout the drilling project.  All base oil was recovered totaling over 4000bbls for a cost recovery of over $1.5million.   The TPS was contracted for a second project of a similar nature in 2002 utilizing the recovered synthetic fluid from the first project which was again received by the TPS and placed in storage to await use in follow on drilling.<br>
<br>
Location:			Tengiz, Kazakhstan<br>
Duration:			2001-Ongoing<br>
Contaminant:		Drill Cuttings<br>
<br>
<br>
The TPS was deployed on contract by the Kazakhstan operating arm of ChevronTexaco to provide base oil recovery and treatment of drill muds and cuttings treatment for its Tengiz program in 2001.  Based upon the performance of the initially supplied single 24mT/day TPS unit, the client requested an additional 55 mT/day unit to allow it to decommission its established bio-remediation program in favour of the TPS and accommodate any increase in drilling activity.  The material being treated is often up to 50% liquid by volume and both units consistently exceed rated capacity by up to 20%.  Treated solids consistently meet the treatment criteria.  The recovered oil is recycled and reused and no date for retiring the TPS from the site has been considered.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Location:			Hasi Masood and Burkine,  Algeria<br>
Duration:			2004-Ongoing<br>
Contaminant:		Drill Cuttings and Production Sludge<br>
<br>
In probably its most ambitious deployment to date, three TPS units, including two 100 mT/day units have been deployed to the Western Desert of Algeria as part of a major drilling project.  The units will be on site for a minimum of 5 years providing a total treatment capacity of over 150 mT/day .  This material will consist of weathered petroleum sludges, the remnants of previous drilling projects, active drilling solids and processing sludges all impacted with a minimum of 25% TPH.<br>
