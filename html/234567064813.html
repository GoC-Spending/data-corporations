&quot;A small (but heartfelt) note to thank you for the great job you did with our home. The whole process was fast, efficient and handled with utmost professionalism at all times. We take a lot of pride in our home and the way it is presented. And the way it looked after it was staged, made us even more proud! Each and every person who walked through the door was in awe! The house was sold after one open house and it was sold well over the asking price!!<br>
<br>
This was the first time we had used home staging services and we have been raving about it ever since. It is definitely a worthwhile investment and the returns surpass your expectations. Our realtor was extremely impressed as well. In fact, he has already called us for your contact information for one of his clients. We would definitely recommend your services without any hesistation.&quot; <br>

&quot;Your services were the major contributing factor to our fast and profitable sale - we obtained multiple offers in the first week of marketing and accepted one at considerably over asking price. In retrospect, we wish we had used you for every house sale we&#39;ve ever made, as this was certainly the fastest and easiest! The whole staging process was fast and efficient and we felt that your commitment to preparing our home for sale was exemplary. We felt we were your only and most important client. Our daughter&#39;s rooms were enhanced whilst respecting their individuality and personal preferences; we never felt our home was compromised in any way by the home staging process. Now that subjects are removed and we&#39;ll be packing soon, you really must come and enjoy the deck with us over a bottle of wine!.&quot; <br>

&quot;We enlisted the aid of Revamp because we did not have furniture suitable to the house and we wanted to sell the house quickly. Not only did the house sell within the first week of listing and staging but we realized $11000 over asking price. Lois and I wanted to compliment you on a number of things that we noted during the recent staging of our house in White Rock. First was the prompt response to our request for information and then there was the professional attitude and creativity, the reasonable and detailed written quote, and the very helpful suggestions on selling in general. The wow!! factor promised by Revamp was definitely there and appreciated by realtors and buyers alike. Thank you Revamp for making the sale of our house happen quickly.&quot; <br>

&quot;We used Revamp homestaging in March when we sold our home of 25 years. Michael and Rien were sooo professional as were all the people they employed on our behalf. We did extensive staging including painting, removal of carpeting, replacement temporary furniture and on and on. The Revamp people worked tirelessly and were great fun to have around. Long and short - house sold in 2 hours for $50,000 over the asking price. The best part was only one showing then back to normal. (whatever normal is) Would totally recommend both the concept and the company.&quot; <br>

&quot;Frances and I are delighted with the results of the staging of our home. We had our first open house on Easter Sunday, received an offer for $52,000 over our asking price and completed our sale the following Tuesday. You completed the alterations with the promised results and with a minimum of disruption to our lives, the sub trades were first rate and the furnishings really created the desired effect. I will admit that when you painted our oak and brass spiral staircase we were a bit in shock. The result however was spectacular. Thank your Rien and Michael for a job well done.&quot; <br>

&quot;I am extremely pleased with the services provided by Revamp Home Staging. Revamp tastefully furnished my client&#39;s home and it sold after only one showing. We received multiple offers and over 10% above asking! I will not hesitate in recommending your services to other Realtors and Homeowners.&quot; <br>

&quot;I just wanted to drop you a note to thank you for the wonderful way that you staged my client&#39;s home. Because it was a little dated the changes Revamp made certainly brought the home up-to-date without the seller having to spend an arm and a leg. The Seller was sure happy to see competitive offers and a full price sale within 5 days. I will definately use your service again with my listings. &quot; <br>

&quot;Revamp were amazing! They listened to the needs of our mutual client which included having the apartment staged in record time. They put together a gorgeous home setting that &#39;wowed&#39; those that viewed it. The suite sold for the highest price in it&#39;s class and in a timely manner. My job of marketing the property was made easier, but more importantly, our client achieved a higher seller price - I have no doubt about it!.&quot; <br>

&quot;My listing competed with another two bedroom (which featured 2 full baths &amp; 2 parking spaces) and the selling price was exactly the same. As you know my two bedroom listing only had 1 bath and 1 parking space. I was stunned to learn that we had won the offer......I believe with the new look you provided for this apartment, it shortened the selling time and increased the selling price by at least 5%. I shall highly recommend your services to all my colleagues, friends and clients.....using your service is one smart decision.&quot; <br>

&quot;Thank you for the great job you did in furnishing and merchandising my condo. You completed the home staging on time and within budget and I received 2 offers within 1 week of you completing your work. My condo is now sold and I received close to my asking price. Thanks, for your role in the sale. I believe that I would not have achieved the price I did without your help, nor would I have sold it so fast. I appreciate your effort in doing an excellent job in all aspects of the home staging and I would definitely recommend you to anyone.&quot; <br>

&quot;I listed the home on Sunday, staged on the Wednesday, first opens on Saturday &amp; Sunday. There was a lot of initial interest in this property so offers were postponed till Sunday at 5pm. The owners were a little overwhelmed, getting 4 offers and $32,000 over asking! I would not hesitate in using REVAMP again, as well as recommend this service to other realtors and homeowners.&quot; <br>

&quot;A small (but heartfelt) note to thank you for the great job you did with our home. The whole process was fast, efficient and handled with utmost professionalism at all times. We take a lot of pride in our home and the way it is presented. And the way it looked after it was staged, made us even more proud! Each and every person who walked through the door was in awe! The house was sold after one open house and it was sold well over the asking price!!<br>
<br>
This was the first time we had used home staging services and we have been raving about it ever since. It is definitely a worthwhile investment and the returns surpass your expectations. Our realtor was extremely impressed as well. In fact, he has already called us for your contact information for one of his clients. We would definitely recommend your services without any hesistation.&quot; <br>

&quot;Your services were the major contributing factor to our fast and profitable sale - we obtained multiple offers in the first week of marketing and accepted one at considerably over asking price. In retrospect, we wish we had used you for every house sale we&#39;ve ever made, as this was certainly the fastest and easiest! The whole staging process was fast and efficient and we felt that your commitment to preparing our home for sale was exemplary. We felt we were your only and most important client. Our daughter&#39;s rooms were enhanced whilst respecting their individuality and personal preferences; we never felt our home was compromised in any way by the home staging process. Now that subjects are removed and we&#39;ll be packing soon, you really must come and enjoy the deck with us over a bottle of wine!.&quot; <br>

&quot;We enlisted the aid of Revamp because we did not have furniture suitable to the house and we wanted to sell the house quickly. Not only did the house sell within the first week of listing and staging but we realized $11000 over asking price. Lois and I wanted to compliment you on a number of things that we noted during the recent staging of our house in White Rock. First was the prompt response to our request for information and then there was the professional attitude and creativity, the reasonable and detailed written quote, and the very helpful suggestions on selling in general. The wow!! factor promised by Revamp was definitely there and appreciated by realtors and buyers alike. Thank you Revamp for making the sale of our house happen quickly.&quot; <br>

&quot;We used Revamp homestaging in March when we sold our home of 25 years. Michael and Rien were sooo professional as were all the people they employed on our behalf. We did extensive staging including painting, removal of carpeting, replacement temporary furniture and on and on. The Revamp people worked tirelessly and were great fun to have around. Long and short - house sold in 2 hours for $50,000 over the asking price. The best part was only one showing then back to normal. (whatever normal is) Would totally recommend both the concept and the company.&quot; <br>

&quot;A small (but heartfelt) note to thank you for the great job you did with our home. The whole process was fast, efficient and handled with utmost professionalism at all times. We take a lot of pride in our home and the way it is presented. And the way it looked after it was staged, made us even more proud! Each and every person who walked through the door was in awe! The house was sold after one open house and it was sold well over the asking price!!<br>
<br>
This was the first time we had used home staging services and we have been raving about it ever since. It is definitely a worthwhile investment and the returns surpass your expectations. Our realtor was extremely impressed as well. In fact, he has already called us for your contact information for one of his clients. We would definitely recommend your services without any hesistation.&quot; <br>

&quot;Your services were the major contributing factor to our fast and profitable sale - we obtained multiple offers in the first week of marketing and accepted one at considerably over asking price. In retrospect, we wish we had used you for every house sale we&#39;ve ever made, as this was certainly the fastest and easiest! The whole staging process was fast and efficient and we felt that your commitment to preparing our home for sale was exemplary. We felt we were your only and most important client. Our daughter&#39;s rooms were enhanced whilst respecting their individuality and personal preferences; we never felt our home was compromised in any way by the home staging process. Now that subjects are removed and we&#39;ll be packing soon, you really must come and enjoy the deck with us over a bottle of wine!.&quot; <br>

&quot;We enlisted the aid of Revamp because we did not have furniture suitable to the house and we wanted to sell the house quickly. Not only did the house sell within the first week of listing and staging but we realized $11000 over asking price. Lois and I wanted to compliment you on a number of things that we noted during the recent staging of our house in White Rock. First was the prompt response to our request for information and then there was the professional attitude and creativity, the reasonable and detailed written quote, and the very helpful suggestions on selling in general. The wow!! factor promised by Revamp was definitely there and appreciated by realtors and buyers alike. Thank you Revamp for making the sale of our house happen quickly.&quot; <br>

&quot;We used Revamp homestaging in March when we sold our home of 25 years. Michael and Rien were sooo professional as were all the people they employed on our behalf. We did extensive staging including painting, removal of carpeting, replacement temporary furniture and on and on. The Revamp people worked tirelessly and were great fun to have around. Long and short - house sold in 2 hours for $50,000 over the asking price. The best part was only one showing then back to normal. (whatever normal is) Would totally recommend both the concept and the company.&quot; <br>

&quot;Frances and I are delighted with the results of the staging of our home. We had our first open house on Easter Sunday, received an offer for $52,000 over our asking price and completed our sale the following Tuesday. You completed the alterations with the promised results and with a minimum of disruption to our lives, the sub trades were first rate and the furnishings really created the desired effect. I will admit that when you painted our oak and brass spiral staircase we were a bit in shock. The result however was spectacular. Thank your Rien and Michael for a job well done.&quot; <br>

&quot;I just wanted to drop you a note to thank you for the wonderful way that you staged my client&#39;s home. Because it was a little dated the changes Revamp made certainly brought the home up-to-date without the seller having to spend an arm and a leg. The Seller was sure happy to see competitive offers and a full price sale within 5 days. I will definately use your service again with my listings. &quot; <br>

&quot;Revamp were amazing! They listened to the needs of our mutual client which included having the apartment staged in record time. They put together a gorgeous home setting that &#39;wowed&#39; those that viewed it. The suite sold for the highest price in it&#39;s class and in a timely manner. My job of marketing the property was made easier, but more importantly, our client achieved a higher seller price - I have no doubt about it!.&quot; <br>

&quot;My listing competed with another two bedroom (which featured 2 full baths &amp; 2 parking spaces) and the selling price was exactly the same. As you know my two bedroom listing only had 1 bath and 1 parking space. I was stunned to learn that we had won the offer......I believe with the new look you provided for this apartment, it shortened the selling time and increased the selling price by at least 5%. I shall highly recommend your services to all my colleagues, friends and clients.....using your service is one smart decision.&quot; <br>

&quot;Thank you for the great job you did in furnishing and merchandising my condo. You completed the home staging on time and within budget and I received 2 offers within 1 week of you completing your work. My condo is now sold and I received close to my asking price. Thanks, for your role in the sale. I believe that I would not have achieved the price I did without your help, nor would I have sold it so fast. I appreciate your effort in doing an excellent job in all aspects of the home staging and I would definitely recommend you to anyone.&quot; <br>

&quot;I listed the home on Sunday, staged on the Wednesday, first opens on Saturday &amp; Sunday. There was a lot of initial interest in this property so offers were postponed till Sunday at 5pm. The owners were a little overwhelmed, getting 4 offers and $32,000 over asking! I would not hesitate in using REVAMP again, as well as recommend this service to other realtors and homeowners.&quot; <br>

&quot;Dear fellow Agents and Home Owners, <br>
Revamp Home Staging provides a valuable and comprehensive service for home owners wishing to sell their property.  Revamp bring their creative eye to a home, offering their expertise to improve the overall &quot;first&quot; impression a home will make to prospective buyers.  Their service goes well above and beyond the standard &quot;designer&quot; as it encompasses all aspects of the home from paint colour to furnishings to those all important smaller finishing touches.  It is a definite benefit to have someone with this dedication to the finished product take part in assisting in preparing a property for sale.  I have found that any listing they have worked with me on received a higher degree of positive exposure with the optimal end result - a sale at the highest price !  I am happy to recommend their service to other Real Estate Agents and home owners.&quot; <br>

&quot;A small (but heartfelt) note to thank you for the great job you did with our home. The whole process was fast, efficient and handled with utmost professionalism at all times. We take a lot of pride in our home and the way it is presented. And the way it looked after it was staged, made us even more proud! Each and every person who walked through the door was in awe! The house was sold after one open house and it was sold well over the asking price!!<br>
<br>
This was the first time we had used home staging services and we have been raving about it ever since. It is definitely a worthwhile investment and the returns surpass your expectations. Our realtor was extremely impressed as well. In fact, he has already called us for your contact information for one of his clients. We would definitely recommend your services without any hesistation.&quot; <br>

&quot;Your services were the major contributing factor to our fast and profitable sale - we obtained multiple offers in the first week of marketing and accepted one at considerably over asking price. In retrospect, we wish we had used you for every house sale we&#39;ve ever made, as this was certainly the fastest and easiest! The whole staging process was fast and efficient and we felt that your commitment to preparing our home for sale was exemplary. We felt we were your only and most important client. Our daughter&#39;s rooms were enhanced whilst respecting their individuality and personal preferences; we never felt our home was compromised in any way by the home staging process. Now that subjects are removed and we&#39;ll be packing soon, you really must come and enjoy the deck with us over a bottle of wine!.&quot; <br>

&quot;We enlisted the aid of Revamp because we did not have furniture suitable to the house and we wanted to sell the house quickly. Not only did the house sell within the first week of listing and staging but we realized $11000 over asking price. Lois and I wanted to compliment you on a number of things that we noted during the recent staging of our house in White Rock. First was the prompt response to our request for information and then there was the professional attitude and creativity, the reasonable and detailed written quote, and the very helpful suggestions on selling in general. The wow!! factor promised by Revamp was definitely there and appreciated by realtors and buyers alike. Thank you Revamp for making the sale of our house happen quickly.&quot; <br>

&quot;We used Revamp homestaging in March when we sold our home of 25 years. Michael and Rien were sooo professional as were all the people they employed on our behalf. We did extensive staging including painting, removal of carpeting, replacement temporary furniture and on and on. The Revamp people worked tirelessly and were great fun to have around. Long and short - house sold in 2 hours for $50,000 over the asking price. The best part was only one showing then back to normal. (whatever normal is) Would totally recommend both the concept and the company.&quot; <br>

&quot;Frances and I are delighted with the results of the staging of our home. We had our first open house on Easter Sunday, received an offer for $52,000 over our asking price and completed our sale the following Tuesday. You completed the alterations with the promised results and with a minimum of disruption to our lives, the sub trades were first rate and the furnishings really created the desired effect. I will admit that when you painted our oak and brass spiral staircase we were a bit in shock. The result however was spectacular. Thank your Rien and Michael for a job well done.&quot; <br>

&quot;I just wanted to drop you a note to thank you for the wonderful way that you staged my client&#39;s home. Because it was a little dated the changes Revamp made certainly brought the home up-to-date without the seller having to spend an arm and a leg. The Seller was sure happy to see competitive offers and a full price sale within 5 days. I will definately use your service again with my listings. &quot; <br>

&quot;Revamp were amazing! They listened to the needs of our mutual client which included having the apartment staged in record time. They put together a gorgeous home setting that &#39;wowed&#39; those that viewed it. The suite sold for the highest price in it&#39;s class and in a timely manner. My job of marketing the property was made easier, but more importantly, our client achieved a higher seller price - I have no doubt about it!.&quot; <br>

&quot;My listing competed with another two bedroom (which featured 2 full baths &amp; 2 parking spaces) and the selling price was exactly the same. As you know my two bedroom listing only had 1 bath and 1 parking space. I was stunned to learn that we had won the offer......I believe with the new look you provided for this apartment, it shortened the selling time and increased the selling price by at least 5%. I shall highly recommend your services to all my colleagues, friends and clients.....using your service is one smart decision.&quot; <br>

&quot;Thank you for the great job you did in furnishing and merchandising my condo. You completed the home staging on time and within budget and I received 2 offers within 1 week of you completing your work. My condo is now sold and I received close to my asking price. Thanks, for your role in the sale. I believe that I would not have achieved the price I did without your help, nor would I have sold it so fast. I appreciate your effort in doing an excellent job in all aspects of the home staging and I would definitely recommend you to anyone.&quot; <br>

&quot;I listed the home on Sunday, staged on the Wednesday, first opens on Saturday &amp; Sunday. There was a lot of initial interest in this property so offers were postponed till Sunday at 5pm. The owners were a little overwhelmed, getting 4 offers and $32,000 over asking! I would not hesitate in using REVAMP again, as well as recommend this service to other realtors and homeowners.&quot; <br>

&quot;Dear fellow Agents and Home Owners, <br>
Revamp Home Staging provides a valuable and comprehensive service for home owners wishing to sell their property.  Revamp bring their creative eye to a home, offering their expertise to improve the overall &quot;first&quot; impression a home will make to prospective buyers.  Their service goes well above and beyond the standard &quot;designer&quot; as it encompasses all aspects of the home from paint colour to furnishings to those all important smaller finishing touches.  It is a definite benefit to have someone with this dedication to the finished product take part in assisting in preparing a property for sale.  I have found that any listing they have worked with me on received a higher degree of positive exposure with the optimal end result - a sale at the highest price !  I am happy to recommend their service to other Real Estate Agents and home owners.&quot; <br>
