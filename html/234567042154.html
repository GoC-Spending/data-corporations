                            Recall is PCI Certified<br>
<br>
The PCI Security Standards Council is an open global forum, launched in 2006, that is responsible for the development, management, education, and awareness of the PCI Security Standards, including the Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS), and PIN Transaction Security (PTS) requirements.<br>
The Council&#39;s five founding global payment brands -- American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc. -- have agreed to incorporate the PCI DSS as the technical requirements of each of their data security compliance programs. Each founding member also recognizes the QSAs, PA-QSAs and ASVs certified by the PCI Security Standards Council.<br>
All five payment brands share equally in the Council&#39;s governance, have equal input into the PCI Security Standards Council and share responsibility for carrying out the work of the organization. Other industry stakeholders are encouraged to join the Council as Participating Organizations and review proposed additions or modifications to the standards.<br>
In security terms, it means that our business adheres to the PCI DSS requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design and other critical protective measures. In operational terms, it means that you are playing your role to make sure your customers&#39; payment card data is being kept safe throughout every transaction, and that they  and you  can have confidence that they&#39;re protected against the pain and cost of data breaches.<br>
<br>
Recall is NAID Certification<br>
<br>
The NAID Certification Program is offered on a voluntary basis to all NAID member companies providing information destruction services. Through the program, NAID members may seek certification audits for Mobile and/or Plant-based operations in paper or printed media, micro media, computer hard drive destruction and/or computer hard drive sanitization. The NAID Certification Program establishes standards for a secure destruction process including such areas as operational security, employee hiring and screening, the destruction process, responsible disposal and insurance.<br>
Under this program, the certification application and associated fees cover only individual locations. If a NAID member operates in multiple locations, each location must pass the audit to be certified. NAID members who receive certification must specify the location certified in company literature when referencing the NAID Certification Program.<br>
<br>
Recall is registered with the Controlled Goods Directorate<br>
<br>
The Controlled Goods Program (CGP) is a Federal Government Program administered by the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).<br>
<br>
The Controlled Goods Directorate (CGD) administers the Controlled Goods Program, a domestic industrial security program that helps strengthen Canada&#39;s defence trade controls and prevents the proliferation of tactical and strategic assets including weapons, satellite global positioning systems and communications equipment, military equipment and related intellectual property. This is done by regulating and controlling the examination, possession, and transfer of controlled goods and controlled technology in Canada. Anyone who conducts business in Canada and examines, possesses and/or transfers controlled goods and/or controlled technology in Canada must comply with the Defence Production Act and the Controlled Goods Regulations.<br>

                            Recall is PCI Certified<br>
<br>
The PCI Security Standards Council is an open global forum, launched in 2006, that is responsible for the development, management, education, and awareness of the PCI Security Standards, including the Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS), and PIN Transaction Security (PTS) requirements.<br>
The Council&#39;s five founding global payment brands -- American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc. -- have agreed to incorporate the PCI DSS as the technical requirements of each of their data security compliance programs. Each founding member also recognizes the QSAs, PA-QSAs and ASVs certified by the PCI Security Standards Council.<br>
All five payment brands share equally in the Council&#39;s governance, have equal input into the PCI Security Standards Council and share responsibility for carrying out the work of the organization. Other industry stakeholders are encouraged to join the Council as Participating Organizations and review proposed additions or modifications to the standards.<br>
In security terms, it means that our business adheres to the PCI DSS requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design and other critical protective measures. In operational terms, it means that you are playing your role to make sure your customers&#39; payment card data is being kept safe throughout every transaction, and that they  and you  can have confidence that they&#39;re protected against the pain and cost of data breaches.<br>
<br>
Recall is NAID Certification<br>
<br>
The NAID Certification Program is offered on a voluntary basis to all NAID member companies providing information destruction services. Through the program, NAID members may seek certification audits for Mobile and/or Plant-based operations in paper or printed media, micro media, computer hard drive destruction and/or computer hard drive sanitization. The NAID Certification Program establishes standards for a secure destruction process including such areas as operational security, employee hiring and screening, the destruction process, responsible disposal and insurance.<br>
Under this program, the certification application and associated fees cover only individual locations. If a NAID member operates in multiple locations, each location must pass the audit to be certified.

Recall is registered with the Controlled Goods Directorate<br>
<br>
The Controlled Goods Program (CGP) is a Federal Government Program administered by the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).<br>
<br>
The Controlled Goods Directorate (CGD) administers the Controlled Goods Program, a domestic industrial security program that helps strengthen Canada&#39;s defence trade controls and prevents the proliferation of tactical and strategic assets including weapons, satellite global positioning systems and communications equipment, military equipment and related intellectual property. This is done by regulating and controlling the examination, possession, and transfer of controlled goods and controlled technology in Canada. Anyone who conducts business in Canada and examines, possesses and/or transfers controlled goods and/or controlled technology in Canada must comply with the Defence Production Act and the Controlled Goods Regulations.<br>
