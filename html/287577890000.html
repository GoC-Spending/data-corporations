                            MX-15 Airborne Surveillance and Reconnaissance<br>
<br>
WESCAM has an airborne portfolio of multi-sensor, multi-spectral systems that are deployed worldwide, at varying ranges, and with overlapping fields-of-view, creating the opportunity for uninterrupted surveillance of boarders, forward operating bases, airfields and other vital assets. WESCAM’s imaging and targeting systems can be found on over 100 different types of platforms, including fixed-wing, rotor-wing, UAV and aerostat platforms. Within WESCAM’s product portfolio is a series of systems that encourage ease and familiarity of use, simplified turret interchangeability within fleets, efficiencies in technology enhancements and overall system support. Featuring common electronics and cabling, common user interfaces and video overlays, and common software and internal components, this family is known as WESCAM’s MX™-Series. Because today’s mission requirements demand identification and designation from longer standoff ranges, the MX-Series has been engineered to focus on the three factors that drive Maximum Range: resolution, magnification and stabilization. As a result, each MX-Series turret in its class-size has outperformed its major competitor in every performance area, giving L-3 WESCAM the longest EO/IR target identification and designating ranges in the industry.<br>

<br>
WESCAM has an airborne portfolio of multi-sensor, multi-spectral systems that are deployed worldwide, at varying ranges, and with overlapping fields-of-view, creating the opportunity for uninterrupted surveillance of boarders, forward operating bases, airfields and other vital assets. WESCAM’s imaging and targeting systems can be found on over 100 different types of platforms, including fixed-wing, rotor-wing, UAV and aerostat platforms. Within WESCAM’s product portfolio is a series of systems that encourage ease and familiarity of use, simplified turret interchangeability within fleets, efficiencies in technology enhancements and overall system support. Featuring common electronics and cabling, common user interfaces and video overlays, and common software and internal components, this family is known as WESCAM’s MX™-Series. Because today’s mission requirements demand identification and designation from longer standoff ranges, the MX-Series has been engineered to focus on the three factors that drive Maximum Range: resolution, magnification and stabilization. As a result, each MX-Series turret in its class-size has outperformed its major competitor in every performance area, giving L-3 WESCAM the longest EO/IR target identification and designating ranges in the industry.<br>

<br>
Support Products<br>
WESCAM has industry-unique hardware tools that support continuous product training and enable immediate troubleshooting, diagnostics and repair capability on fielded MX systems that are deployed worldwide. Continually evolving, WESCAM invests heavily in these solutions that are designed to minimize operational downtime and maximize customer knowledge.<br>
<br>
MX-RAid – Remote Aid for WESCAM’s MX-Series of EO/IR Turrets<br>
<br>
We offer an advanced service kit for remote diagnostic evaluation of fielded MX-Series EO/IR systems. This exclusive capability provides WESCAM’s customers immediate access to an in-house factory technician who can diagnose actual system faults from afar.<br>
<br>
The MX-RAid provides a remote aid diagnostic capability and is a powerful tool for remote troubleshooting, diagnostics and prognostic/predictive maintenance planning.<br>
<br>
How MX-RAid Works:<br>
<br>
MX-RAid over the Internet<br>
Provides a data link between a WESCAM technician and the fielded MX system, allowing for live video, voice or text chat capability and the streaming of live video.  This access is made available via an internet connection between the system’s remote diagnostic computer and the technician’s diagnostic computer. The technician’s computer can located at any one of WESCAM’s Authorized Service Centre (WASC) facilities.<br>
<br>
MX-RAid via Satellite<br>
Provides both voice and a data link between the WESCAM technician and field maintenance personnel.  This access is made available via a connection between the system and satellite modem.  After a quick and easy set-up at the end users location, the WESCAM technician can access the MX system and perform diagnostics through a dedicated IP address.<br>
<br>
MX-RAid Benefits:<br>
Benefit/Result<br>
• Access to WESCAM trained technicians<br>
   • Potential reduced repair cycle time<br>
• Faster and more accurate fault isolation – reduced time in repairing turret faults<br>
   • Reduced downtime for the end user, resulting in improved availability<br>
• Ability to enable adjustments in order to return some turrets to operational capability<br>
   • Provides increased system availability<br>
• Virtually eliminates the occurrence of “No Fault Found” (NFF) systems<br>
   • Elimination of some system returns to factory<br>
• Lower life-cycle costs<br>
   • Reduction in overall system support costs by eliminating the need to return systems for NFF or minor repairs<br>
<br>
Security:<br>
• MX-RAid can’t be initiated during flight, and is considered remote ground support equipment<br>
• The only connection made to the MX system is through the internal maintenance software – this limits information to internal diagnostic and maintenance information<br>
• The internet version allows sensor images to be transmitted at the customers discretion<br>
• If the MX system has GPS capability, the GPS can be disabled by unplugging the GPS cable which removes the GPS coordinates from the overlay menus:<br>

                            MX-15 Airborne Surveillance and Reconnaissance<br>
<br>
WESCAM has an airborne portfolio of multi-sensor, multi-spectral systems that are deployed worldwide, at varying ranges, and with overlapping fields-of-view, creating the opportunity for uninterrupted surveillance of boarders, forward operating bases, airfields and other vital assets. WESCAM’s imaging and targeting systems can be found on over 100 different types of platforms, including fixed-wing, rotor-wing, UAV and aerostat platforms. Within WESCAM’s product portfolio is a series of systems that encourage ease and familiarity of use, simplified turret interchangeability within fleets, efficiencies in technology enhancements and overall system support. Featuring common electronics and cabling, common user interfaces and video overlays, and common software and internal components, this family is known as WESCAM’s MX™-Series. Because today’s mission requirements demand identification and designation from longer standoff ranges, the MX-Series has been engineered to focus on the three factors that drive Maximum Range: resolution, magnification and stabilization. As a result, each MX-Series turret in its class-size has outperformed its major competitor in every performance area, giving L-3 WESCAM the longest EO/IR target identification and designating ranges in the industry.<br>

<br>
WESCAM has an airborne portfolio of multi-sensor, multi-spectral systems that are deployed worldwide, at varying ranges, and with overlapping fields-of-view, creating the opportunity for uninterrupted surveillance of boarders, forward operating bases, airfields and other vital assets. WESCAM’s imaging and targeting systems can be found on over 100 different types of platforms, including fixed-wing, rotor-wing, UAV and aerostat platforms. Within WESCAM’s product portfolio is a series of systems that encourage ease and familiarity of use, simplified turret interchangeability within fleets, efficiencies in technology enhancements and overall system support. Featuring common electronics and cabling, common user interfaces and video overlays, and common software and internal components, this family is known as WESCAM’s MX™-Series. Because today’s mission requirements demand identification and designation from longer standoff ranges, the MX-Series has been engineered to focus on the three factors that drive Maximum Range: resolution, magnification and stabilization. As a result, each MX-Series turret in its class-size has outperformed its major competitor in every performance area, giving L-3 WESCAM the longest EO/IR target identification and designating ranges in the industry.<br>

<br>
Support Products<br>
WESCAM has industry-unique hardware tools that support continuous product training and enable immediate troubleshooting, diagnostics and repair capability on fielded MX systems that are deployed worldwide. Continually evolving, WESCAM invests heavily in these solutions that are designed to minimize operational downtime and maximize customer knowledge.<br>
<br>
MX-RAid – Remote Aid for WESCAM’s MX-Series of EO/IR Turrets<br>
<br>
We offer an advanced service kit for remote diagnostic evaluation of fielded MX-Series EO/IR systems. This exclusive capability provides WESCAM’s customers immediate access to an in-house factory technician who can diagnose actual system faults from afar.<br>
<br>
The MX-RAid provides a remote aid diagnostic capability and is a powerful tool for remote troubleshooting, diagnostics and prognostic/predictive maintenance planning.<br>
<br>
How MX-RAid Works:<br>
<br>
MX-RAid over the Internet<br>
Provides a data link between a WESCAM technician and the fielded MX system, allowing for live video, voice or text chat capability and the streaming of live video.  This access is made available via an internet connection between the system’s remote diagnostic computer and the technician’s diagnostic computer. The technician’s computer can located at any one of WESCAM’s Authorized Service Centre (WASC) facilities.<br>
<br>
MX-RAid via Satellite<br>
Provides both voice and a data link between the WESCAM technician and field maintenance personnel.  This access is made available via a connection between the system and satellite modem.  After a quick and easy set-up at the end users location, the WESCAM technician can access the MX system and perform diagnostics through a dedicated IP address.<br>
<br>
MX-RAid Benefits:<br>
Benefit/Result<br>
• Access to WESCAM trained technicians<br>
   • Potential reduced repair cycle time<br>
• Faster and more accurate fault isolation – reduced time in repairing turret faults<br>
   • Reduced downtime for the end user, resulting in improved availability<br>
• Ability to enable adjustments in order to return some turrets to operational capability<br>
   • Provides increased system availability<br>
• Virtually eliminates the occurrence of “No Fault Found” (NFF) systems<br>
   • Elimination of some system returns to factory<br>
• Lower life-cycle costs<br>
   • Reduction in overall system support costs by eliminating the need to return systems for NFF or minor repairs<br>
<br>
Security:<br>
• MX-RAid can’t be initiated during flight, and is considered remote ground support equipment<br>
• The only connection made to the MX system is through the internal maintenance software – this limits information to internal diagnostic and maintenance information<br>
• The internet version allows sensor images to be transmitted at the customers discretion<br>
• If the MX system has GPS capability, the GPS can be disabled by unplugging the GPS cable which removes the GPS coordinates from the overlay menus:<br>
