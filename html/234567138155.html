              “To Jarrod &amp; the amazing Sax Appeal Ottawa, We wanted to say THANK YOU SO MUCH for your wonderful music at our wedding reception! You and your group are so talented, the music was such a pleasure to listen to! We received an incredible number of compliments regarding your music from our guests, a number of whom told us they would pay to go and listen to your group at another event. Your music was flawless, elegant, and perfect in volume - people were able to hear your group, but it wasn&#39;t so loud that people couldn&#39;t talk. You all looked very professional, in your formal-wear, and we really appreciate that you matched your tuxedo colour accents to the colour scheme of our wedding! The music selection was incredible, exactly what we were hoping for and looking for! You did a fantastic job of catering to our tastes, and playing a variety of music to suit the guests&#39; tastes as well. In addition to the great music your group played, Jarrod, you were just wonderful to work with. We cannot thank you enough for all you did to help take weight off our shoulders and assist with tasks along the way. You were always easy to reach, quick to answer, and ready to help, on things beyond those that we hired your group for. You were constantly offering help to make our day run as smoothly as possible, and that meant a lot to us! We want to have another event just so we can hire your group to play! We would highly, HIGHLY recommend you and Sax Appeal to anyone who needed a musical group for an event. You, and your group, rose above and beyond our expectations! We hope to be able to hire you again in the future!” (Jennifer Brigandi - Bride).<br>
<br>
“On behalf of the Ottawa Catholic School Board, please accept my thanks for providing expert musical instruction to our students at our board-wide Music Festival. You have demonstrated a notable commitment to arts education and have provided a rich experience for our students as they pursue their goals and aspirations as fledgling artists. The OCSB Music Festival has been successful, thanks in no small part to the generous donation of time and expertise which you provided.  You’ve added such a special dimension to the day with your performance and expertise!” (Katie Lewis-Prieur – OCSB Arts Consultant 7-12). <br>
<br>
“Ce fut pour nous un ajout tres important a la cérémonie… musiciens en toxedo…les pieces de musique choisies a l’image de la cérémonie et du cocktail……..l’ambiance était a son meilleur! PERFECT … PERFECT … PERFECT! WE COULD NOT ASK FOR MORE. MANY THANKS” (Francine &amp; Hubert, Bride and Groom).<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to thank you and your playing partner for adding a unique element to my/our retirement /house warming party. Our guests were quite impressed with your performance and for our part I must say that you made it very easy for us as we didn’t need to do anything special to accommodate you. I also appreciated the fact that you decided that a sax duo would be appropriate for our gathering of 35 – 40 guests. I hope I will be able to engage your services for future events and will certainly recommend you to friends and relatives” (Michael Farrell).<br>
<br>
“It was a real pleasure to have Sax Appeal. We couldn’t wish for better. It was absolutely amazing. Very elegant, very professional [and] it blended perfectly with the ambiance we wanted in the Grand Hall. Thank you again for this perfect evening. I will not hesitate to recommend Sax Appeal to all Museum of Civilization clients!” (Geneviève Mercier – Sales Executive, Museum of Civilization).<br>
<br>
“I have worked with Jarrod Goldsmith of Sax Appeal on many occasions and have always found him to be a very reliable person who is extremely organized. He really is a true leader in all sense of the word. Besides being an exceptional entrepreneur with a unique ensemble, he is an excellent musician who knows the music industry inside-out. Would love to work with Sax Appeal again! I definitively have to agree that their slogan: “Always the right feel with Sax Appeal” is well deserved”. (Wasim Baobaid - Storyline Productions).<br>
<br>
“I recently had the pleasure to photograph Sax Appeal at the Museum of Civilization, and I was extremely impressed. The music was elegant and unique, and not only were they passionate and brilliant musicians, but they were also a wonderful group of gentlemen. I would highly recommend Sax Appeal for any special event as they are sure to impress!” (Lesley Ferguson Photography). <br>
<br>
&quot;The wisest thing I have done in years is to hire the saxophone quartet called “SAX APPEAL” to entertain at a family gathering in Ottawa. Their music resonated deeply in a way that allowed all of the 50 people of all ages to relax, smile and just plain enjoy the atmosphere in the party room. The quartet has a broad array of music in their program and each and every piece worked wonderfully well!&quot; (Barry Karp).<br>
<br>
&quot;Jarrod is a consummate professional. He is innovative and knowledgeable as well as talented and dependable. His knowledge of music and his body of work are extensive. He is practiced and passionate about his gift while being a pleasure to work with!” (Trina Langthorne - Owner, 4 Octaves). <br>
<br>
&quot;Jarrod is a very talented musician with a good ear. He is very professional and dependable. I had the joy of playing with him in a couple of bands on Montreal. Jarrod shows great knowledge in his sax playing and his music selection. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a well rounded and educated individual and who is very knowledgeable in his field”. (Kim McIntyre - Agent de Gestion des Cas Intérimaire / Acting Case Management Officer). <br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve had the pleasure of listening to Jarrod perform on several occasions. He is a talented and charismatic saxophone player who really knows how to get a room moving”. (Krista Dolan-Kilrea - Senior HR Strategy Advisor at Shared Services Canada).

              “To Jarrod &amp; the amazing Sax Appeal Ottawa, We wanted to say THANK YOU SO MUCH for your wonderful music at our wedding reception! You and your group are so talented, the music was such a pleasure to listen to! We received an incredible number of compliments regarding your music from our guests, a number of whom told us they would pay to go and listen to your group at another event. Your music was flawless, elegant, and perfect in volume - people were able to hear your group, but it wasn&#39;t so loud that people couldn&#39;t talk. You all looked very professional, in your formal-wear, and we really appreciate that you matched your tuxedo colour accents to the colour scheme of our wedding! The music selection was incredible, exactly what we were hoping for and looking for! You did a fantastic job of catering to our tastes, and playing a variety of music to suit the guests&#39; tastes as well. In addition to the great music your group played, Jarrod, you were just wonderful to work with. We cannot thank you enough for all you did to help take weight off our shoulders and assist with tasks along the way. You were always easy to reach, quick to answer, and ready to help, on things beyond those that we hired your group for. You were constantly offering help to make our day run as smoothly as possible, and that meant a lot to us! We want to have another event just so we can hire your group to play! We would highly, HIGHLY recommend you and Sax Appeal to anyone who needed a musical group for an event. You, and your group, rose above and beyond our expectations! We hope to be able to hire you again in the future!” (Jennifer Brigandi - Bride).<br>
<br>
“On behalf of the Ottawa Catholic School Board, please accept my thanks for providing expert musical instruction to our students at our board-wide Music Festival. You have demonstrated a notable commitment to arts education and have provided a rich experience for our students as they pursue their goals and aspirations as fledgling artists. The OCSB Music Festival has been successful, thanks in no small part to the generous donation of time and expertise which you provided.  You’ve added such a special dimension to the day with your performance and expertise!” (Katie Lewis-Prieur – OCSB Arts Consultant 7-12). <br>
<br>
“Ce fut pour nous un ajout tres important a la cérémonie… musiciens en toxedo…les pieces de musique choisies a l’image de la cérémonie et du cocktail……..l’ambiance était a son meilleur! PERFECT … PERFECT … PERFECT! WE COULD NOT ASK FOR MORE. MANY THANKS” (Francine &amp; Hubert, Bride and Groom).<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to thank you and your playing partner for adding a unique element to my/our retirement /house warming party. Our guests were quite impressed with your performance and for our part I must say that you made it very easy for us as we didn’t need to do anything special to accommodate you. I also appreciated the fact that you decided that a sax duo would be appropriate for our gathering of 35 – 40 guests. I hope I will be able to engage your services for future events and will certainly recommend you to friends and relatives” (Michael Farrell).<br>
<br>
“It was a real pleasure to have Sax Appeal. We couldn’t wish for better. It was absolutely amazing. Very elegant, very professional [and] it blended perfectly with the ambiance we wanted in the Grand Hall. Thank you again for this perfect evening. I will not hesitate to recommend Sax Appeal to all Museum of Civilization clients!” (Geneviève Mercier – Sales Executive, Museum of Civilization).<br>
<br>
“I have worked with Jarrod Goldsmith of Sax Appeal on many occasions and have always found him to be a very reliable person who is extremely organized. He really is a true leader in all sense of the word. Besides being an exceptional entrepreneur with a unique ensemble, he is an excellent musician who knows the music industry inside-out. Would love to work with Sax Appeal again! I definitively have to agree that their slogan: “Always the right feel with Sax Appeal” is well deserved”. (Wasim Baobaid - Storyline Productions).<br>
<br>
“I recently had the pleasure to photograph Sax Appeal at the Museum of Civilization, and I was extremely impressed. The music was elegant and unique, and not only were they passionate and brilliant musicians, but they were also a wonderful group of gentlemen. I would highly recommend Sax Appeal for any special event as they are sure to impress!” (Lesley Ferguson Photography). <br>
<br>
&quot;The wisest thing I have done in years is to hire the saxophone quartet called “SAX APPEAL” to entertain at a family gathering in Ottawa. Their music resonated deeply in a way that allowed all of the 50 people of all ages to relax, smile and just plain enjoy the atmosphere in the party room. The quartet has a broad array of music in their program and each and every piece worked wonderfully well!&quot; (Barry Karp).<br>
<br>
&quot;Jarrod is a consummate professional. He is innovative and knowledgeable as well as talented and dependable. His knowledge of music and his body of work are extensive. He is practiced and passionate about his gift while being a pleasure to work with!” (Trina Langthorne - Owner, 4 Octaves). <br>
<br>
&quot;Jarrod is a very talented musician with a good ear. He is very professional and dependable. I had the joy of playing with him in a couple of bands on Montreal. Jarrod shows great knowledge in his sax playing and his music selection. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a well rounded and educated individual and who is very knowledgeable in his field”. (Kim McIntyre - Agent de Gestion des Cas Intérimaire / Acting Case Management Officer). <br>
<br>
&quot;I&#39;ve had the pleasure of listening to Jarrod perform on several occasions. He is a talented and charismatic saxophone player who really knows how to get a room moving”. (Krista Dolan-Kilrea - Senior HR Strategy Advisor at Shared Services Canada).
