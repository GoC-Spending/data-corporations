&quot;The City of Saskatoon has been a client since 2003 and utilizes Reflex for land development.

The City had several specialized reports that needed to be created, and with the latest upgrade to Version 10.0, are now able to create ad-hoc queries with the use of Reflex Analytics. The City is also in the process of implementing the Commercial property management module to manage all City leases, which includes buildings, signage, farm land and easements.&quot; - Jeremy Meinema, Finance and Sales Manager, City of Saskatoon<br>

&quot;Comco Pipe and Supply has had a long standing partnership with the principle owners of Reflex that spans over 25 years. Our company depends on the tight interrelationship of our IT systems with our business processes and having a single IT partner such as Reflex to provide a fully integrated end-to-end solution for all aspects of our business is one of the key drivers that keeps us ahead of the competition. The system provides support for head office accounting and administration with full auditability for routing key controls and logging as well as configurable dashboards for extensive reporting and management insight.

&quot;Our partnership with Reflex Enterprise Solutions Group spans over 25 years as both companies have worked closely together to integrate business and technology management to achieve greater agility, productivity and ultimately a more enriched value stream for the services we provide to our dealers. With Reflex we deal with one company and one fully integrated enterprise solution that serves all facets of the Factor business processes - Integrated Accounting, H/R and Payroll, Work Order / Docket Management, Production Control and Management, Inventory Control and Order Management, Automated Pricing, Dealer Self-service Portals for order placement and production tracking, Customer Relationship Management and much more. As a company we have always used our software to a competitive advantage, and in today&#39;s marketplace, that is more important than ever. Our sales team can now leverage this information to build even stronger relationships with their customers.

<br>
&quot;We at Remai Group, encompassing many legal entities, have been a client since 2009 and utilize Reflex for Residential and Commercial property Management, Construction Management, Payroll and HR as well as the full financial suite. In 2008, we searched the marketplace for an Enterprise solution that would be relevant for all of our business units as the notion of implementing multiple point solutions (i.e. possibly from different vendors) that all have a different look and feel was not an option. After an exhaustive review of the options available, Reflex was chosen as the solution to manage the many facets of our business. Since then, Reflex has been that one solution and is very effective in helping us manage all aspects of our property management and construction operations. The talented staff at Reflex have been very responsive both in providing support when required and also in receiving and implementing recommendations for improvements that would benefit us and their other clients as well. We are very pleased to have chosen Reflex and continue to work closely with them as our information partner.&quot; - Nicholle Povhe, Chief Financial Officer, Remai Group of Companies<br>
<br>
&quot;Our company has seen tremendous expansion in the past 15 years both through internal growth and geographic expansion in Western Canada. We have enjoyed working with the Reflex Enterprise software solution and their team of professionals to assist us in aligning our business processes with the IT systems for seamless integration and management visibility throughout all levels of the organization. We now have an appreciation of the value of true master data management as we are able to look at real time data anytime / anywhere and turn it into the information we need to run our company and serve our clients in the most effective manner. Reflex solutions are designed to fit the way we do business and offer extensive personalization without the need for custom development. In addition to enjoying the benefits of having one fully integrated ERP solution with no &quot;bolt-ons,&quot; we have also implemented the Reflex embedded document manager that has allowed us to achieve a 99% paperless office environment.&quot; - Michel Leroux, Vice President and General Manager, Summit Valve and Controls Inc.

&quot;The City of Saskatoon has been a client since 2003 and utilizes Reflex for land development.

&quot;Comco Pipe and Supply has had a long standing partnership with the principle owners of Reflex that spans over 25 years. Our company depends on the tight interrelationship of our IT systems with our business processes and having a single IT partner such as Reflex to provide a fully integrated end-to-end solution for all aspects of our business is one of the key drivers that keeps us ahead of the competition. The system provides support for head office accounting and administration with full auditability for routing key controls and logging as well as configurable dashboards for extensive reporting and management insight.

<br>
&quot;We at Remai Group, encompassing many legal entities, have been a client since 2009 and utilize Reflex for Residential and Commercial property Management, Construction Management, Payroll and HR as well as the full financial suite. In 2008, we searched the marketplace for an Enterprise solution that would be relevant for all of our business units as the notion of implementing multiple point solutions (i.e. possibly from different vendors) that all have a different look and feel was not an option. After an exhaustive review of the options available, Reflex was chosen as the solution to manage the many facets of our business. Since then, Reflex has been that one solution and is very effective in helping us manage all aspects of our property management and construction operations. The talented staff at Reflex have been very responsive both in providing support when required and also in receiving and implementing recommendations for improvements that would benefit us and their other clients as well. We are very pleased to have chosen Reflex and continue to work closely with them as our information partner.&quot; - Nicholle Povhe, Chief Financial Officer, Remai Group of Companies<br>
<br>
&quot;Our company has seen tremendous expansion in the past 15 years both through internal growth and geographic expansion in Western Canada. We have enjoyed working with the Reflex Enterprise software solution and their team of professionals to assist us in aligning our business processes with the IT systems for seamless integration and management visibility throughout all levels of the organization. We now have an appreciation of the value of true master data management as we are able to look at real time data anytime / anywhere and turn it into the information we need to run our company and serve our clients in the most effective manner. Reflex solutions are designed to fit the way we do business and offer extensive personalization without the need for custom development. In addition to enjoying the benefits of having one fully integrated ERP solution with no &quot;bolt-ons,&quot; we have also implemented the Reflex embedded document manager that has allowed us to achieve a 99% paperless office environment.&quot; - Michel Leroux, Vice President and General Manager, Summit Valve and Controls Inc.
