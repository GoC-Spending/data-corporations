                            Information Management Systems are now strategic to any organisation, and new, highly integrated computing infrastructures are creating the need for new roles and skills. Business architects, program managers, and contractors are replacing systems analysts and project managers. Automating technologies and outsourcing have eliminated many traditional positions, and new breeds of user-friendly technology are making many traditional skills obsolete. A new management paradigm is emerging: information management is becoming an integral part of the business strategy, and business managers are becoming increasingly responsible for their technology investment and its outcome.<br>
Decentralised computing is sweeping business and government. Its advance is inevitable - and for some powerful reasons. Economics is one important factor. Individuals and small groups can develop computer applications faster and less expensively than large teams can. Strategic and organisational factors are also driving the decentralisation of computing power. Within organisations, the emergence of confident and capable computer users has created a powerful constituency favouring decentralisation. Employees want to operate their own systems, in their own way, and when its most effective for them.<br>
The Dunrobin Group employs simple but effective processes and instruments to support all aspects of the management of information and technology. We can act as a catalyst to help our clients chart their organisations management issues, by identifying and resolving the critical problems in order to set and meet essential business objectives.<br>
The Dunrobin Group assists senior management in taking charge of its information management and processing strategies, and this trend is evident in the growth of our consulting practice. We are very active in re-engineering the businesses of our clients to take advantage of information technology. Instead of using computers and information management systems to automate the way a business has always run, we first re-engineer the functions and then assist management to apply computing power to the new ways of working. The results are the best that our customers have seen in years, with savings as high as 80%. This top-down approach to the utilisation of technology involves the most senior levels of management and requires that we treat technology the same way as other vital corporate resources.<br>
The firms professionals are experienced in directing large information technology investments, the introduction of information management policies and practices within organisations, and management of the complete resource acquisition process to augment management, systems, staff and equipment.<br>

                            Dunrobin Group professionals have conducted over 100 performance evaluations and assessments of information technology managements and investments. A consultative approach has proved to be the most effective in terms of long-lasting improvements to the performance of the information technology function, and, at the same time, provides the most value to the government or agency. We conduct the examination of each issue in constant consultation with the people most affected by the issue, and discuss our findings, both negative and positive, as we go along.<br>
We start by assessing the governance over information technology and its systems and processes, keeping in mind the business goal of adding value while balancing risk versus return. Next, we evaluate the integrated IT framework that ensures delivery of information to the business, and that addresses the required information criteria including Effectiveness, Efficiency, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Compliance.<br>
We measure performance against key goal indicators including:<br>
 Enhanced performance and cost management;<br>
 Improved return on major IT investments;<br>
 Improved time to market;<br>
 Increased quality, innovation and risk management;<br>
 Appropriately integrated and standardised business processes;<br>
 Reaching new and satisfying existing customers;<br>
 Availability of appropriate bandwidth, computing power and IT delivery mechanisms;<br>
 Meeting requirements and expectations of the customer of the process on budget and on time;<br>
 Adherence to laws, regulations, industry standards and contractual commitments;<br>
 Transparency on risk taking and adherence to the agreed organisational risk profile;<br>
 Benchmarking comparisons of IT governance maturity; and,<br>
 Creation of new service delivery channels.<br>
The Dunrobin Group approach to an assessment is to provide a foundation for improvement by clearly enunciating best-of-breed good management practice in the areas of information and technology. We discuss the primary issues and principles of information management, define the criteria we use to assess issues, define the assessment activities performed, and provide findings and recommendations.<br>
We look for:<br>
 Improved cost-efficiency of IT processes (costs vs. deliverables);<br>
 Increased number of IT action plans for process improvement initiatives;<br>
 Increased utilisation of IT infrastructure;<br>
 Increased satisfaction of stakeholders (survey and number of complaints);<br>
 Improved staff productivity (number of deliverables) and morale (survey);<br>
 Increased availability of knowledge and information for managing the enterprise;<br>
 Increased linkage between IT and enterprise governance; and,<br>
 Improved performance as measured by IT balanced scorecards.<br>
In order to ensure that only matters of significance are brought to the attention of the client, we assess the materiality and risk of each issue and then decide whether to include the issue in the main report or in a management letter to the IT management. This approach determines the severity of an issue, and defines in what context and to what extent. We provide indicators and other early warning signals of potential issues, including a lack of due regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the organisations management of its information assets.<br>
We use our exclusive five-stage methodology consisting of: <br>
 Initial discussions with senior management;<br>
 Review of existing systems, structures, policies, and practices;<br>
 Analysis, examination, and determination of matters of significance;<br>
 Preparation and delivery of the report; and,<br>
 Acceptance and implementation of recommendations.<br>

                            The single, most important critical success factor for any business or government is the relationship of trust that is developed between the enterprise and its clients and stakeholders. Gartner Group has noted the recent slowdown in the growth of Internet commerce and ascribes its declining growth of popularity to a breakdown of the basic trust mechanisms in the marketplace. The public constantly hears of identity theft and loss of privacy, corporate espionage, customer profiling and the sale of confidential information, spam, viruses, and other security breaches, corporate misbehaviour and fraud, all of which contributes to a decay of customer confidence in the electronic marketplace.<br>
Organisations must actively pursue a policy of Trust Management. Dunrobin Group provides its clients with the following Trust Management services.<br>
Risk Management and Vulnerability Assessments<br>
Risk Management should be a collaborative process between the enterprises business managers and its Information Technology community, involving a shared understanding of requirements, risks, vulnerabilities and goals. The Dunrobin Group utilizes a comprehensive Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) process as an integral component of our approach to IT security development and implementation. The Vulnerability Assessment is the fundamental instrument underlying our risk management methodologies, and is used to compel the most appropriate layered security architectures, which can safeguard data and services in a cost effective manner, and especially in todays complex networked environment. The process is implemented across the system life-cycle, from the planning stage, where the process measures risk variables at a high level, through to a progressively more refined measurement of technical threat and vulnerability across the design, implementation and operational phases of the project. It is the mechanism by which the probability and impact of threat events is measured, and the system by which management is able to assess residual risk associated with different security solutions. It monitors risk and is able to maintain residual risk within acceptable limits throughout the in-service phase of projects, and is also the mechanism that is used to derive the requirements for formal or informal certification and accreditation of systems and system components.<br>
Security Audits and Reviews<br>
In order to remain competitive in the world economy, organizations must achieve their business objectives through the effective use of Information Management Technology. This places critical information assets at risk if adequate safeguards are not implemented to address the inherent vulnerabilities that exist in many information systems. These vulnerabilities can affect the availability or proper functioning of Information Technology Infrastructure. The Dunrobin Group believes that the formulation of broad-based approaches, such as enterprise wide strategies and electronic security frameworks, can be effective ways in which to deal with issues that can affect business success. As a result, our client organizations are approaching their information management challenges in very structured ways to minimize investment and to ensure that the result is consistent with their enterprises business mission and objectives.<br>
The Dunrobin Group Consultants perform security audits that include comprehensive examination of the following factors that contribute to a definable security posture including:<br>
 Legislation, statutes, or regulations that apply;<br>
Enterprise-wide security policies and standards;<br>
 Security Risk Management Framework;<br>
 Information System Security Certification &amp; Accreditation; and,<br>
 Physical and Environmental security and business continuity planning.<br>
Privacy Impact Assessments<br>
Advancements in information and communications technologies are changing the ways that organizations operate, and in which citizens conduct their lives. Taking advantage of such advances will assist organizations in remaining both relevant and competitive in the global marketplace. However, as electronic transactions, exchanges, and information sharing increase, organizations must take steps to protect personal information and to ensure that privacy is maintained. The Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act impacts all companies conducting business in Canada. Dunrobin Group has the understanding and experience to identify and implement approaches that result in safeguards that will assist in managing the risk. <br>
Dunrobin Group management consultants have worked with clients in: <br>
 Conducting Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs);<br>
 Linking PIAs and security risk management to identify efficiencies; <br>
 Identifying administrative and technical safeguards;<br>
 Completing privacy audits; and,<br>
 Developing and delivering presentations on privacy obligations and approaches to finding security solutions.<br>
Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning<br>
The importance of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning is paramount in today&#39;s fast-paced environment. The reliance on information management systems is so profound that its availability can mean the difference between success and failure. Our goal is to provide our clients with optimal methods to conduct prevention, response, resumption, recovery and restoration services, should any of these events occur to prevent normal operations. Our incident response and continuity plans are fully documented and operationally tested at a frequency commensurate with the risk and magnitude of loss or harm that could result from an incident that causes a disruption or denial of services.<br>
Dunrobin Group provides the following Business Continuity/Incident Response development services: <br>
 Review of the organization, policies and procedures, and network architecture to gain an understanding of the processes and business functions within the organization;<br>
 Identification of the critical business functions by conducting a Business Impact Analysis (BIA). These functions are identified at the level of business units and their major supporting systems and applications. They are conducted with the objective of identifying the impact on the organization of the loss of vital business functions and systems;<br>
 Identification and documentation of critical business processes and tasks performed by each of the business units identified by the BIA. This helps to identify priorities for recovery of specific business operations and support systems;<br>
 Identification and documentation of the resources needed to implement the plan;<br>
 Organization of the teams responsible for carrying out the Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery plan in the event of an incident/disaster; and<br>
 Establishment of procedures for testing and maintaining the plan and training recovery team members.<br>

                            Globalization, the information revolution, the Internet, and the democratization of international relations are all bringing about a fundamental change in the way the world works. Countries are no longer isolated from the technological advances of the Information Highway and all its promise. The strategic use of information, and the ability to influence others by presenting integrated models and ideas, have become central components of a governments ability to exert political, economic and cultural influence. In this new world, where borders are increasingly porous and the marketplace is crowded with new information sources, the idea is now well established that knowledge and information confer influence, and that influence is power.<br>
Modern information management and communications systems have become affordable, crucial, enabling technologies for social and economic development and effective governance on a global scale. <br>
Unfortunately for many countries with developing economies, the rich promise of technology is elusive. There is a Digital Divide. The issue is that many countries do not have adequate information and technology management skills within the government itself to participate in the rewards of increased investments in technology. Governments will need to focus on how ICT can be harnessed for economic development and democratization. Once the basic governance and technology infrastructure policies are place, ICT related businesses will be able to invest in the country.<br>
Governments will have to move their countries towards more tightly coupled networks, shared facilities, and common services and standards. As well, their ICT support industries must be encouraged to keep pace with the newest technology initiatives. There are several key issues that need to be addressed with respect to the development of improved ICT facilities for a countrys national economic growth.<br>
For example, there is typically inadequate experience in many governments to manage and regulate an up-to-date ICT infrastructure. There are isolated efforts under way in some countries, often without clear leadership and guidance, to assist in the development of integrated approaches. And, once a strategy for developing an environment is in place to enable ICT investments, skilled resources are then needed to build, manage and develop the facilities that are required.<br>
Dunrobin Group offers extensive, directly applicable experience in implementing ICT infrastructure governance and policy. At the same time, we have well-developed policies and practices to enable the sharing of this expertise. We also have the skills and teaching capacity, and our strategic objective is to help emerging countries energize these capabilities.<br>

                            In the future, the elements of improved information management performance will be radically different from those we see today. There is an emerging gap between the management policies of the past and the needs dictated by a fast-changing technological environment. Serving the public with value-added intangibles such as quality, service, ease of communications, and simplicity, will require new structures, processes, relationships and objectives.<br>
This coming transformation within organisations will be fundamentally different from the traditional changes we have seen in the past. It will involve extensive, orderly and systematic efforts to radically redesign how people work and communicate, changing not only how an entity works internally, but also how it interacts with its public and other departments and agencies. The environment for this transformation will be widespread; it will not be achieved by changing single divisions, branches, processes, functions, or measurement systems. It will demand the highly committed and visible participation of senior officials, managers, and staff at all levels, and a much more integrated approach to the management of information and technology.<br>
Information management and its related technologies are changing the rules for how organisations can be structured and managed. Because it is increasingly able to provide powerful support to the way people think and work, information technology can lead to order-of-magnitude improvements in organisational and individual performance and efficiency.<br>
Management of information and technology is becoming more and more distributed throughout organisations. The old CIO branch, or EDP shop, is shifting, from being the sole provider and controller of technology, to being one of the many enablers of technology in an organization. In summary, new information management functions will have to focus on managing the distribution of new technology to end-users, the building of an information &quot;utility&quot; of systems, and the institutionalizing of data management and integrity.<br>
The Dunrobin Group is staffed with professionals who will:<br>
 Introduce a strategic thinking process that can complement operational planning processes already in place;<br>
 Involve key people in defining and shaping the future of information and technology management within the target organisation;<br>
 Provide a forum and processes that can help senior officials look at the information management issues in a collaborative context;<br>
 Set direction through consensus and commitment, and provide an opportunity for team building, sustainability and personal growth; and,<br>
 Transfer our knowledge to the client for long-term sustainability.<br>

                            Excellence (or good value) is a goal that takes time and effort to achieve. It requires leadership, doing the right things more often than not, learning from experience, and careful risk and opportunity assessment. It also takes hard, sustained work. There are no quick fixes, no short cuts, and no simple formulae to produce excellence, or good value. <br>
A recent study by IBM indicates that IT investments, to which traditional approaches have been applied, and without adequate monitoring, can require up to five times the computer capacity and development effort of the systems they replace. In the private sector in North America, 25% of large development projects are abandoned before completion; 60% incur significant time and cost overruns; and less than 1% finish on time, on budget and fulfil user expectations. And the average large system costs twice the original estimate and is delivered more than a year late.<br>
Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) can mitigate risk and improve the project management performance of the organisation responsible for information management technology investments, by the effective application of independent systems tests, evaluation practices, and techniques to the projects products and processes, and with the timely reporting of significant issues. The Dunrobin Group can provide tailored technical, program management, and financial analyses to the governance authorities of the project, by applying systems engineering &quot;best practices&quot; to evaluate correctness and quality.<br>
We look at requirements, as well as products and processes throughout the project life cycle. This means that IV&amp;V benefits both the customer and supplier. It is an integral part of creating an effective customer for the supplier. <br>
IV&amp;V reviews the key methods and how they are implemented and used, reviews the project at key gates, examines the processes, and provides resources for performing product acceptance. It is also the sanity test on project direction, execution and deliverables, and a vehicle to ensure issues are visible to, and do not stay unresolved, at the executive levels. IV&amp;V provides a fairness monitor function in the proposal selection process, and then follows the project through to implementation.<br>
IV&amp;V can also contribute to the determination of the completeness of each milestone, and the ability of the Vendor to continue to meet the needs of the organisation, at each milestone review. We can also conduct post-implementation Functional Configuration Audits and the Physical Configuration Audits. The Physical Configuration Audit determines that all the physical components specified in the negotiated contract have been fully and completely delivered, and the Functional Configuration Audit determines that the requirements of the Contract and the Requirements Specification have been met, and that the products function as required.<br>

                            Information Management Systems are now strategic to any organisation, and new, highly integrated computing infrastructures are creating the need for new roles and skills. Business architects, program managers, and contractors are replacing systems analysts and project managers. Automating technologies and outsourcing have eliminated many traditional positions, and new breeds of user-friendly technology are making many traditional skills obsolete. A new management paradigm is emerging: information management is becoming an integral part of the business strategy, and business managers are becoming increasingly responsible for their technology investment and its outcome.<br>
Decentralised computing is sweeping business and government. Its advance is inevitable - and for some powerful reasons. Economics is one important factor. Individuals and small groups can develop computer applications faster and less expensively than large teams can. Strategic and organisational factors are also driving the decentralisation of computing power. Within organisations, the emergence of confident and capable computer users has created a powerful constituency favouring decentralisation. Employees want to operate their own systems, in their own way, and when its most effective for them.<br>
The Dunrobin Group employs simple but effective processes and instruments to support all aspects of the management of information and technology. We can act as a catalyst to help our clients chart their organisations management issues, by identifying and resolving the critical problems in order to set and meet essential business objectives.<br>
The Dunrobin Group assists senior management in taking charge of its information management and processing strategies, and this trend is evident in the growth of our consulting practice. We are very active in re-engineering the businesses of our clients to take advantage of information technology. Instead of using computers and information management systems to automate the way a business has always run, we first re-engineer the functions and then assist management to apply computing power to the new ways of working. The results are the best that our customers have seen in years, with savings as high as 80%. This top-down approach to the utilisation of technology involves the most senior levels of management and requires that we treat technology the same way as other vital corporate resources.<br>
The firms professionals are experienced in directing large information technology investments, the introduction of information management policies and practices within organisations, and management of the complete resource acquisition process to augment management, systems, staff and equipment.<br>

                            Dunrobin Group professionals have conducted over 100 performance evaluations and assessments of information technology managements and investments. A consultative approach has proved to be the most effective in terms of long-lasting improvements to the performance of the information technology function, and, at the same time, provides the most value to the government or agency. We conduct the examination of each issue in constant consultation with the people most affected by the issue, and discuss our findings, both negative and positive, as we go along.<br>
We start by assessing the governance over information technology and its systems and processes, keeping in mind the business goal of adding value while balancing risk versus return. Next, we evaluate the integrated IT framework that ensures delivery of information to the business, and that addresses the required information criteria including Effectiveness, Efficiency, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Compliance.<br>
We measure performance against key goal indicators including:<br>
 Enhanced performance and cost management;<br>
 Improved return on major IT investments;<br>
 Improved time to market;<br>
 Increased quality, innovation and risk management;<br>
 Appropriately integrated and standardised business processes;<br>
 Reaching new and satisfying existing customers;<br>
 Availability of appropriate bandwidth, computing power and IT delivery mechanisms;<br>
 Meeting requirements and expectations of the customer of the process on budget and on time;<br>
 Adherence to laws, regulations, industry standards and contractual commitments;<br>
 Transparency on risk taking and adherence to the agreed organisational risk profile;<br>
 Benchmarking comparisons of IT governance maturity; and,<br>
 Creation of new service delivery channels.<br>
The Dunrobin Group approach to an assessment is to provide a foundation for improvement by clearly enunciating best-of-breed good management practice in the areas of information and technology. We discuss the primary issues and principles of information management, define the criteria we use to assess issues, define the assessment activities performed, and provide findings and recommendations.<br>
We look for:<br>
 Improved cost-efficiency of IT processes (costs vs. deliverables);<br>
 Increased number of IT action plans for process improvement initiatives;<br>
 Increased utilisation of IT infrastructure;<br>
 Increased satisfaction of stakeholders (survey and number of complaints);<br>
 Improved staff productivity (number of deliverables) and morale (survey);<br>
 Increased availability of knowledge and information for managing the enterprise;<br>
 Increased linkage between IT and enterprise governance; and,<br>
 Improved performance as measured by IT balanced scorecards.<br>
In order to ensure that only matters of significance are brought to the attention of the client, we assess the materiality and risk of each issue and then decide whether to include the issue in the main report or in a management letter to the IT management. This approach determines the severity of an issue, and defines in what context and to what extent. We provide indicators and other early warning signals of potential issues, including a lack of due regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the organisations management of its information assets.<br>
We use our exclusive five-stage methodology consisting of: <br>
 Initial discussions with senior management;<br>
 Review of existing systems, structures, policies, and practices;<br>
 Analysis, examination, and determination of matters of significance;<br>
 Preparation and delivery of the report; and,<br>
 Acceptance and implementation of recommendations.<br>

                            The single, most important critical success factor for any business or government is the relationship of trust that is developed between the enterprise and its clients and stakeholders. Gartner Group has noted the recent slowdown in the growth of Internet commerce and ascribes its declining growth of popularity to a breakdown of the basic trust mechanisms in the marketplace. The public constantly hears of identity theft and loss of privacy, corporate espionage, customer profiling and the sale of confidential information, spam, viruses, and other security breaches, corporate misbehaviour and fraud, all of which contributes to a decay of customer confidence in the electronic marketplace.<br>
Organisations must actively pursue a policy of Trust Management. Dunrobin Group provides its clients with the following Trust Management services.<br>
Risk Management and Vulnerability Assessments<br>
Risk Management should be a collaborative process between the enterprises business managers and its Information Technology community, involving a shared understanding of requirements, risks, vulnerabilities and goals. The Dunrobin Group utilizes a comprehensive Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) process as an integral component of our approach to IT security development and implementation. The Vulnerability Assessment is the fundamental instrument underlying our risk management methodologies, and is used to compel the most appropriate layered security architectures, which can safeguard data and services in a cost effective manner, and especially in todays complex networked environment. The process is implemented across the system life-cycle, from the planning stage, where the process measures risk variables at a high level, through to a progressively more refined measurement of technical threat and vulnerability across the design, implementation and operational phases of the project. It is the mechanism by which the probability and impact of threat events is measured, and the system by which management is able to assess residual risk associated with different security solutions. It monitors risk and is able to maintain residual risk within acceptable limits throughout the in-service phase of projects, and is also the mechanism that is used to derive the requirements for formal or informal certification and accreditation of systems and system components.<br>
Security Audits and Reviews<br>
In order to remain competitive in the world economy, organizations must achieve their business objectives through the effective use of Information Management Technology. This places critical information assets at risk if adequate safeguards are not implemented to address the inherent vulnerabilities that exist in many information systems. These vulnerabilities can affect the availability or proper functioning of Information Technology Infrastructure. The Dunrobin Group believes that the formulation of broad-based approaches, such as enterprise wide strategies and electronic security frameworks, can be effective ways in which to deal with issues that can affect business success. As a result, our client organizations are approaching their information management challenges in very structured ways to minimize investment and to ensure that the result is consistent with their enterprises business mission and objectives.<br>
The Dunrobin Group Consultants perform security audits that include comprehensive examination of the following factors that contribute to a definable security posture including:<br>
 Legislation, statutes, or regulations that apply;<br>
Enterprise-wide security policies and standards;<br>
 Security Risk Management Framework;<br>
 Information System Security Certification &amp; Accreditation; and,<br>
 Physical and Environmental security and business continuity planning.<br>
Privacy Impact Assessments<br>
Advancements in information and communications technologies are changing the ways that organizations operate, and in which citizens conduct their lives. Taking advantage of such advances will assist organizations in remaining both relevant and competitive in the global marketplace. However, as electronic transactions, exchanges, and information sharing increase, organizations must take steps to protect personal information and to ensure that privacy is maintained. The Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act impacts all companies conducting business in Canada. Dunrobin Group has the understanding and experience to identify and implement approaches that result in safeguards that will assist in managing the risk. <br>
Dunrobin Group management consultants have worked with clients in: <br>
 Conducting Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs);<br>
 Linking PIAs and security risk management to identify efficiencies; <br>
 Identifying administrative and technical safeguards;<br>
 Completing privacy audits; and,<br>
 Developing and delivering presentations on privacy obligations and approaches to finding security solutions.<br>
Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning<br>
The importance of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning is paramount in today&#39;s fast-paced environment. The reliance on information management systems is so profound that its availability can mean the difference between success and failure. Our goal is to provide our clients with optimal methods to conduct prevention, response, resumption, recovery and restoration services, should any of these events occur to prevent normal operations. Our incident response and continuity plans are fully documented and operationally tested at a frequency commensurate with the risk and magnitude of loss or harm that could result from an incident that causes a disruption or denial of services.<br>
Dunrobin Group provides the following Business Continuity/Incident Response development services: <br>
 Review of the organization, policies and procedures, and network architecture to gain an understanding of the processes and business functions within the organization;<br>
 Identification of the critical business functions by conducting a Business Impact Analysis (BIA). These functions are identified at the level of business units and their major supporting systems and applications. They are conducted with the objective of identifying the impact on the organization of the loss of vital business functions and systems;<br>
 Identification and documentation of critical business processes and tasks performed by each of the business units identified by the BIA. This helps to identify priorities for recovery of specific business operations and support systems;<br>
 Identification and documentation of the resources needed to implement the plan;<br>
 Organization of the teams responsible for carrying out the Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery plan in the event of an incident/disaster; and<br>
 Establishment of procedures for testing and maintaining the plan and training recovery team members.<br>

                            Globalization, the information revolution, the Internet, and the democratization of international relations are all bringing about a fundamental change in the way the world works. Countries are no longer isolated from the technological advances of the Information Highway and all its promise. The strategic use of information, and the ability to influence others by presenting integrated models and ideas, have become central components of a governments ability to exert political, economic and cultural influence. In this new world, where borders are increasingly porous and the marketplace is crowded with new information sources, the idea is now well established that knowledge and information confer influence, and that influence is power.<br>
Modern information management and communications systems have become affordable, crucial, enabling technologies for social and economic development and effective governance on a global scale. <br>
Unfortunately for many countries with developing economies, the rich promise of technology is elusive. There is a Digital Divide. The issue is that many countries do not have adequate information and technology management skills within the government itself to participate in the rewards of increased investments in technology. Governments will need to focus on how ICT can be harnessed for economic development and democratization. Once the basic governance and technology infrastructure policies are place, ICT related businesses will be able to invest in the country.<br>
Governments will have to move their countries towards more tightly coupled networks, shared facilities, and common services and standards. As well, their ICT support industries must be encouraged to keep pace with the newest technology initiatives. There are several key issues that need to be addressed with respect to the development of improved ICT facilities for a countrys national economic growth.<br>
For example, there is typically inadequate experience in many governments to manage and regulate an up-to-date ICT infrastructure. There are isolated efforts under way in some countries, often without clear leadership and guidance, to assist in the development of integrated approaches. And, once a strategy for developing an environment is in place to enable ICT investments, skilled resources are then needed to build, manage and develop the facilities that are required.<br>
Dunrobin Group offers extensive, directly applicable experience in implementing ICT infrastructure governance and policy. At the same time, we have well-developed policies and practices to enable the sharing of this expertise. We also have the skills and teaching capacity, and our strategic objective is to help emerging countries energize these capabilities.<br>

                            In the future, the elements of improved information management performance will be radically different from those we see today. There is an emerging gap between the management policies of the past and the needs dictated by a fast-changing technological environment. Serving the public with value-added intangibles such as quality, service, ease of communications, and simplicity, will require new structures, processes, relationships and objectives.<br>
This coming transformation within organisations will be fundamentally different from the traditional changes we have seen in the past. It will involve extensive, orderly and systematic efforts to radically redesign how people work and communicate, changing not only how an entity works internally, but also how it interacts with its public and other departments and agencies. The environment for this transformation will be widespread; it will not be achieved by changing single divisions, branches, processes, functions, or measurement systems. It will demand the highly committed and visible participation of senior officials, managers, and staff at all levels, and a much more integrated approach to the management of information and technology.<br>
Information management and its related technologies are changing the rules for how organisations can be structured and managed. Because it is increasingly able to provide powerful support to the way people think and work, information technology can lead to order-of-magnitude improvements in organisational and individual performance and efficiency.<br>
Management of information and technology is becoming more and more distributed throughout organisations. The old CIO branch, or EDP shop, is shifting, from being the sole provider and controller of technology, to being one of the many enablers of technology in an organization. In summary, new information management functions will have to focus on managing the distribution of new technology to end-users, the building of an information &quot;utility&quot; of systems, and the institutionalizing of data management and integrity.<br>
The Dunrobin Group is staffed with professionals who will:<br>
 Introduce a strategic thinking process that can complement operational planning processes already in place;<br>
 Involve key people in defining and shaping the future of information and technology management within the target organisation;<br>
 Provide a forum and processes that can help senior officials look at the information management issues in a collaborative context;<br>
 Set direction through consensus and commitment, and provide an opportunity for team building, sustainability and personal growth; and,<br>
 Transfer our knowledge to the client for long-term sustainability.<br>

                            Excellence (or good value) is a goal that takes time and effort to achieve. It requires leadership, doing the right things more often than not, learning from experience, and careful risk and opportunity assessment. It also takes hard, sustained work. There are no quick fixes, no short cuts, and no simple formulae to produce excellence, or good value. <br>
A recent study by IBM indicates that IT investments, to which traditional approaches have been applied, and without adequate monitoring, can require up to five times the computer capacity and development effort of the systems they replace. In the private sector in North America, 25% of large development projects are abandoned before completion; 60% incur significant time and cost overruns; and less than 1% finish on time, on budget and fulfil user expectations. And the average large system costs twice the original estimate and is delivered more than a year late.<br>
Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) can mitigate risk and improve the project management performance of the organisation responsible for information management technology investments, by the effective application of independent systems tests, evaluation practices, and techniques to the projects products and processes, and with the timely reporting of significant issues. The Dunrobin Group can provide tailored technical, program management, and financial analyses to the governance authorities of the project, by applying systems engineering &quot;best practices&quot; to evaluate correctness and quality.<br>
We look at requirements, as well as products and processes throughout the project life cycle. This means that IV&amp;V benefits both the customer and supplier. It is an integral part of creating an effective customer for the supplier. <br>
IV&amp;V reviews the key methods and how they are implemented and used, reviews the project at key gates, examines the processes, and provides resources for performing product acceptance. It is also the sanity test on project direction, execution and deliverables, and a vehicle to ensure issues are visible to, and do not stay unresolved, at the executive levels. IV&amp;V provides a fairness monitor function in the proposal selection process, and then follows the project through to implementation.<br>
IV&amp;V can also contribute to the determination of the completeness of each milestone, and the ability of the Vendor to continue to meet the needs of the organisation, at each milestone review. We can also conduct post-implementation Functional Configuration Audits and the Physical Configuration Audits. The Physical Configuration Audit determines that all the physical components specified in the negotiated contract have been fully and completely delivered, and the Functional Configuration Audit determines that the requirements of the Contract and the Requirements Specification have been met, and that the products function as required.<br>
