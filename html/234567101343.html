        <br>            Sidorov Advanced Driver Training offers specialized training in driving under all conditions from dirt road to city streets and superhighways. We work on building the proper skills, tactics and attitude for precision driving. <br><br>Sidorov Advanced Driver Training works with the BC Forest Safety Council and Western Silviculture Contractors&#39; Association in developing resource road driver training for operators of pickup trucks and other utility vehicles. Also, within the same structure, designs and provides courses for operators of ATVs/UTVs.<br><br>Our clients include individuals, groups, and businesses. The company can manage complete ride-and-drive events, as well as press days and testing programs. <br><br>Our training is geared towards more efficient vehicle use, which can yield significant savings in fuel consumption and maintenance costs. Insurance premiums may be affected as well. Precision/advanced driving programs can be part of an overall &quot;green&quot; campaign aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of both groups and individuals.<br><br>One of our specialties is training operators of 15-passenger vans, SUVs, pickup trucks, and other utility vehicles.<br><br>Alan Sidorov, the company owner, has an extensive background in international racing, coaching fellow racers, teaching advanced driving courses, film work, public speaking, radio and television.

Sidorov Advanced Driver Training provides skid control and winter driver training to Blackcomb Aviation. This includes skid control with heavy trailers, which are often used to haul fuel and supplies to remoter helicopter bases.

To Whom It May Concern; <br>
Re: Alan Sidorov, Sidorov Sports Consultants, Inc. <br>
<br>
This is to confirm that the BC Safety Council has worked with Alan Sidorov and his group in the area of traffic safety education and driver training. Specifically, we have worked with them in the field of winter driving. In addition, both organizations have consulted with each other on an ongoing basis for several years.<br>
<br>
Alans background in automobile racing and high performance driving has provided extensive experience of value to drivers of all sorts of vehicles in all driving conditions and circumstances. His credibility in this regard is unquestioned as his personal knowledge of vehicle technologies and his experience in its application is so extensive. <br>
 <br>
In addition to these credentials, however, we respect the ability of his instructional team to deliver education and training at the appropriate level for the audience. As a safety organization, we also appreciate the fact that their commitment to safe driving practices is paramount and not oriented towards ego enhancement of would-be high performance drivers. <br>
 <br>
In my opinion Alan and his team will bring to prospective clients education and training that will enhance the effectiveness of their operations in real-world practical applications while also supporting their due diligence as employers concerned with the safety and wellbeing of their employees. <br>
 <br>
We look forward to working with Alan and his team in coming years in joint efforts towards safer and more proficient driving practices. <br>

              With the Resort Municipality of Whistler, we have conducted training programs for drivers of 15-passenger vans as well as a variety of utility vehicles including snowplows. Other successful projects for RMOW include trailer towing schools and winter driving clinics for bylaws staff. We are the designated trainers for Whistler Fire Rescue. Sidorov Advanced Driver Training provides skid control and winter driver training to Blackcomb Aviation. This includes skid control with heavy trailers, which are often used to haul fuel and supplies to remoter helicopter bases.

              We have established a coordinated driver training program for fire rescue services in Whistler and Pemberton. This includes training for personally owned vehicles, pickups or vans from each department, and apparatus. (Large fire trucks) Alan Sidorov re-designed the resource road driver training program run through the Western Silviculture Contractors&#39; Association and the BC Forest Safety Council. The curriculum, driver training, and instructor development now meet international standards. This program is now being offered to all users of resource roads, including geologists, archeologists, surveyors, mining companies, and other users of utility vehicles in extreme and remote environments.

To Whom It May Concern; <br>
Re: Alan Sidorov, Sidorov Sports Consultants, Inc. <br>
<br>
This is to confirm that the BC Safety Council has worked with Alan Sidorov and his group in the area of traffic safety education and driver training. Specifically, we have worked with them in the field of winter driving. In addition, both organizations have consulted with each other on an ongoing basis for several years.<br>
<br>
Alans background in automobile racing and high performance driving has provided extensive experience of value to drivers of all sorts of vehicles in all driving conditions and circumstances. His credibility in this regard is unquestioned as his personal knowledge of vehicle technologies and his experience in its application is so extensive. <br>
 <br>
In addition to these credentials, however, we respect the ability of his instructional team to deliver education and training at the appropriate level for the audience. As a safety organization, we also appreciate the fact that their commitment to safe driving practices is paramount and not oriented towards ego enhancement of would-be high performance drivers. <br>
 <br>
In my opinion Alan and his team will bring to prospective clients education and training that will enhance the effectiveness of their operations in real-world practical applications while also supporting their due diligence as employers concerned with the safety and wellbeing of their employees. <br>
 <br>
We look forward to working with Alan and his team in coming years in joint efforts towards safer and more proficient driving practices. <br>
