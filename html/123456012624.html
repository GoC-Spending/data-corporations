                            ROYNAT... more than money... business financing specialists <br>
<br>
Winning in business is about reaching goals... that&#39;s where we <br>
come in RoyNat has been helping small and medium size business <br>
realize its goals for more than 35 years...We&#39;ve met exceptional <br>
people along the way and, time and again, seen companies that <br>
began as little more than ideas turn into robust, competitive <br>
going concerns.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve participated in mergers and aquisitions that made small <br>
companies serious players in both domestic and international <br>
markets. We&#39;ve helped managers buy out owners. We&#39;ve taken equity <br>
positions to help foster growth, and we&#39;ve built valuable <br>
long-term relationships that have endured through difficult times <br>
as well as good.<br>
<br>
Working in this strong and growing sector of the Canadian Economy <br>
has taught us a thing or two over the years, perhaps none more <br>
important than this:<br>
 Success is ultimately about the people who manage <br>
 businesses...and not simply about balance sheets<br>
<br>
Today, RoyNat is the leading company in Canada&#39;s private sector <br>
specializing in term financing and merchant banking services. We <br>
provide funding for acquiring fixed assets, refinancing existing <br>
borrowings, working capital, mergers and acquisitions and, most <br>
recently, for succession.<br>
<br>
We are proud of differences that separate us from conventional <br>
lenders. In our offices across the country you will find managers <br>
who are first and foremost business people, if not literally, <br>
then certainly in attitude and understanding.<br>
<br>
Formula lending is absent. Our managers build financial <br>
strategies that support and strengthen business plans by using <br>
term funds, subordinated debt and/or equity tailored to the best <br>
advantage of our clients. In addition, they look beyond common <br>
financial ratios and factor in more difficult to measure assets <br>
such as management ability and a companies competitive position <br>
within its industry.<br>
<br>
Experience and expertise have made RoyNat a specialist. Our <br>
managers understand business. They understand the need to be <br>
prompt, resourceful and flexible. They understand that agreements <br>
made today should not become encumbrances tomorrow. They <br>
understand the importance of standing by their clients.<br>

Term Financing is used to:<br>
-purchase an existing business<br>
-construct, expand, or modernize a plant or other facility<br>
-purchase new equipment, machinery, or vehicles<br>
-provide working capital<br>
-refinance or consolidate debt<br>
-finance a merger or aquisition<br>
<br>
Lease Financing:<br>
Leasing should always be an option when new equipment is <br>
required. The question of when to use leasing services, or <br>
whether to use them, requires assessment of a number of financial <br>
variables that are usually company specific and sometimes <br>
complex.<br>
<br>
Leases can be fully expensed and are often less costly than a <br>
loan. In addition, a lease might free capital for other, more <br>
productive purposes.<br>
<br>
RoyNat&#39;s staff, well versed in leasing and experienced in all <br>
aspects of business financing, is able to advise clients about <br>
the wide range of equipment financing opportunities that are <br>
available. They will work with management to put together the <br>
best-priced leasing package relative to financial considerations <br>
and business objectives.<br>
<br>
In some instances, a term loan might be the solution. In others, <br>
a lease, a lease line, or a lease in combination with other <br>
financial products, might prove to be the most cost effective.<br>
<br>
MERCHANT BANKING:<br>
<br>
Subordinated debt and equity - the tools of merchant banking - <br>
are commonly used to facilitate:<br>
 - leveraged buyouts<br>
 - management buyouts<br>
 - aquisitions<br>
 - growth and major expansions<br>
 - succession financing<br>
<br>
Merchant Banking can also be used for bridge financing pending a <br>
public issue. In addition, we will assist clients by evaluating a <br>
target company in an aquisition; by structuring a transaction; by <br>
packaging financing requirements; or by negotiating for <br>
additional funds. We will also have our Mergers and Aquisitions <br>
department help existing clients exit their business by sourcing <br>
a new purchaser or help an existing client find additional target <br>
companies to buy.<br>
<br>
Simply put, we start with what&#39;s best for the business and work <br>
from there. The end result is a partnership structured in the <br>
present that is well positioned for the future.<br>
<br>
SUCCESSION FINANCING:<br>
<br>
It is estimated that more than half of Canada&#39;s family-owned <br>
businesses will change hands over the next ten to fifteen years <br>
as the leading edge of the baby boom moves into retirement. In <br>
anticipation, RoyNat added Succession Financing to its portfolio <br>
because how well an owner-manager plans succession will determine <br>
not only the price for the business, but also the success of the <br>
transition.<br>
<br>
RoyNat is only one component of the succession planning team, <br>
which will include legal, accounting and insurance advisors. The <br>
team will draw up a plan that will profile a buyer or buyers <br>
capable of taking over the business; establish value; deal with <br>
tax, legal and insurance issues; set a transition strategy and <br>
structure appropriate financing.<br>
<br>
The advantage of establishing succession well in advance of <br>
retirement is flexibility, particularly how and when an owner can <br>
be paid out. Early planning also protects against unforseen <br>
circumstances, such as illness, disability, divorce or <br>
shareholders disputes.<br>
<br>
Experience in succession financing is important because each <br>
case, at core, is unique. When selecting a financial institution, <br>
ask first about experience, because understanding personal and <br>
business needs and crafting the most effective mix of financing <br>
instruments are of paramount importance.<br>
<br>
The deepest pitfall is starting too late. Too many owners find it <br>
difficult to acdept retirement and sale of their business, and <br>
delay dealing with the issue, often at severe cost to themselves <br>
and sometimes to the detriment of an orderly transfer of <br>
ownership. Prudent owners begin thinking about succession as long <br>
as ten years in advance.<br>
<br>
TWO SOURCES ARE BETTER THAN ONE...<br>
<br>
Successful companies typically have more than one source of <br>
funds...long term from a specialist lender, such as RoyNat, and <br>
an operating line of credit from a chartered bank. More than one <br>
source ensures flexibility of supply, creates built-in price <br>
competition and provides a basis for service comparisons.<br>
<br>
Fixed and floating interest rates are also available and how each <br>
used is largely a function of economic circumstances and a <br>
client&#39;s preference. Sometimes it can be an advantage to choose a <br>
floating rate with an option to fix at a later date. On the other <br>
hand, a fixed rate, which makes money a predictable cost, <br>
enhances management&#39;s ability to plan ahead.<br>

                            ROYNAT... more than money... business financing specialists <br>
<br>
Winning in business is about reaching goals... that&#39;s where we <br>
come in RoyNat has been helping small and medium size business <br>
realize its goals for more than 35 years...We&#39;ve met exceptional <br>
people along the way and, time and again, seen companies that <br>
began as little more than ideas turn into robust, competitive <br>
going concerns.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve participated in mergers and aquisitions that made small <br>
companies serious players in both domestic and international <br>
markets. We&#39;ve helped managers buy out owners. We&#39;ve taken equity <br>
positions to help foster growth, and we&#39;ve built valuable <br>
long-term relationships that have endured through difficult times <br>
as well as good.<br>
<br>
Working in this strong and growing sector of the Canadian Economy <br>
has taught us a thing or two over the years, perhaps none more <br>
important than this:<br>
 Success is ultimately about the people who manage <br>
 businesses...and not simply about balance sheets<br>
<br>
Today, RoyNat is the leading company in Canada&#39;s private sector <br>
specializing in term financing and merchant banking services. We <br>
provide funding for acquiring fixed assets, refinancing existing <br>
borrowings, working capital, mergers and acquisitions and, most <br>
recently, for succession.<br>
<br>
We are proud of differences that separate us from conventional <br>
lenders. In our offices across the country you will find managers <br>
who are first and foremost business people, if not literally, <br>
then certainly in attitude and understanding.<br>
<br>
Formula lending is absent. Our managers build financial <br>
strategies that support and strengthen business plans by using <br>
term funds, subordinated debt and/or equity tailored to the best <br>
advantage of our clients. In addition, they look beyond common <br>
financial ratios and factor in more difficult to measure assets <br>
such as management ability and a companies competitive position <br>
within its industry.<br>
<br>
Experience and expertise have made RoyNat a specialist. Our <br>
managers understand business. They understand the need to be <br>
prompt, resourceful and flexible. They understand that agreements <br>
made today should not become encumbrances tomorrow. They <br>
understand the importance of standing by their clients.<br>
<br>
TERM LOANS:<br>
Term Financing is used to:<br>
-purchase an existing business<br>
-construct, expand, or modernize a plant or other facility<br>
-purchase new equipment, machinery, or vehicles<br>
-provide working capital<br>
-refinance or consolidate debt<br>
-finance a merger or aquisition<br>
<br>
Lease Financing:<br>
Leasing should always be an option when new equipment is <br>
required. The question of when to use leasing services, or <br>
whether to use them, requires assessment of a number of financial <br>
variables that are usually company specific and sometimes <br>
complex.<br>
<br>
Leases can be fully expensed and are often less costly than a <br>
loan. In addition, a lease might free capital for other, more <br>
productive purposes.<br>
<br>
RoyNat&#39;s staff, well versed in leasing and experienced in all <br>
aspects of business financing, is able to advise clients about <br>
the wide range of equipment financing opportunities that are <br>
available. They will work with management to put together the <br>
best-priced leasing package relative to financial considerations <br>
and business objectives.<br>
<br>
In some instances, a term loan might be the solution. In others, <br>
a lease, a lease line, or a lease in combination with other <br>
financial products, might prove to be the most cost effective.<br>
<br>
MERCHANT BANKING:<br>
<br>
Subordinated debt and equity - the tools of merchant banking - <br>
are commonly used to facilitate:<br>
 - leveraged buyouts<br>
 - management buyouts<br>
 - aquisitions<br>
 - growth and major expansions<br>
 - succession financing<br>
<br>
Merchant Banking can also be used for bridge financing pending a <br>
public issue. In addition, we will assist clients by evaluating a <br>
target company in an aquisition; by structuring a transaction; by <br>
packaging financing requirements; or by negotiating for <br>
additional funds. We will also have our Mergers and Aquisitions <br>
department help existing clients exit their business by sourcing <br>
a new purchaser or help an existing client find additional target <br>
companies to buy.<br>
<br>
Simply put, we start with what&#39;s best for the business and work <br>
from there. The end result is a partnership structured in the <br>
present that is well positioned for the future.<br>
<br>
SUCCESSION FINANCING:<br>
<br>
It is estimated that more than half of Canada&#39;s family-owned <br>
businesses will change hands over the next ten to fifteen years <br>
as the leading edge of the baby boom moves into retirement. In <br>
anticipation, RoyNat added Succession Financing to its portfolio <br>
because how well an owner-manager plans succession will determine <br>
not only the price for the business, but also the success of the <br>
transition.<br>
<br>
RoyNat is only one component of the succession planning team, <br>
which will include legal, accounting and insurance advisors. The <br>
team will draw up a plan that will profile a buyer or buyers <br>
capable of taking over the business; establish value; deal with <br>
tax, legal and insurance issues; set a transition strategy and <br>
structure appropriate financing.<br>
<br>
The advantage of establishing succession well in advance of <br>
retirement is flexibility, particularly how and when an owner can <br>
be paid out. Early planning also protects against unforseen <br>
circumstances, such as illness, disability, divorce or <br>
shareholders disputes.<br>
<br>
Experience in succession financing is important because each <br>
case, at core, is unique. When selecting a financial institution, <br>
ask first about experience, because understanding personal and <br>
business needs and crafting the most effective mix of financing <br>
instruments are of paramount importance.<br>
<br>
The deepest pitfall is starting too late. Too many owners find it <br>
difficult to acdept retirement and sale of their business, and <br>
delay dealing with the issue, often at severe cost to themselves <br>
and sometimes to the detriment of an orderly transfer of <br>
ownership. Prudent owners begin thinking about succession as long <br>
as ten years in advance.<br>
<br>
TWO SOURCES ARE BETTER THAN ONE...<br>
<br>
Successful companies typically have more than one source of <br>
funds...long term from a specialist lender, such as RoyNat, and <br>
an operating line of credit from a chartered bank. More than one <br>
source ensures flexibility of supply, creates built-in price <br>
competition and provides a basis for service comparisons.<br>
<br>
Fixed and floating interest rates are also available and how each <br>
used is largely a function of economic circumstances and a <br>
client&#39;s preference. Sometimes it can be an advantage to choose a <br>
floating rate with an option to fix at a later date. On the other <br>
hand, a fixed rate, which makes money a predictable cost, <br>
enhances management&#39;s ability to plan ahead.<br>
<br>
We are a businessman&#39;s lender providing an array of financial <br>
solutions for today&#39;s growing business challenges. With offices <br>
across the country we are able to service business from coast to <br>
coast.<br>
