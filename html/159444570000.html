IV	PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
In addition to providing design and analytical services, the Weir-Jones Group has developed a range of proprietary products and systems designed to enhance the safety and cost-effective operation of various types of vessels.  These include:<br>
<br>
AUTOMATIC DRAUGHT INDICATOR SYSTEM - ADIS<br>
<br>
With the support and co-operation of the British Columbia Ferry Corporation, the Group developed an Automatic Draught Indicator System, ADIS, for commercial vessels.   The system has the following significant features:<br>
<br>
&amp;#8729;	No hull penetrations are required, and an installation can be completed in as little as 8 hours on existing vessels. <br>
&amp;#8729;	ADIS is significantly less costly than systems requiring hull penetration and is essentially maintenance free.  Mean time between failures exceeds 50,000 hrs.<br>
&amp;#8729;	ADIS can provide very accurate draught measurements during cargo loading.<br>
&amp;#8729;	ADIS provides real-time loading information about hogging, sagging and inclination.<br>
&amp;#8729;	The ADIS real-time digital bridge display shows the draught of the vessel, port and starboard, forward, amidships and aft with an accuracy of better than ±2 cm.<br>
<br>
B.C. Ferries operates one of the worlds largest ferry fleets and require an accurate, reliable and cost effective solution to their draught monitoring system needs. The ADIS system was designed to meet their specific requirements and it has proven to be extremely reliable during a ten vessel three year Beta test programme. This system is now available to marine operators as a commercial product with distribution and support available internationally.<br>
<br>
HULL CONDITION MONITORING SYSTEMS AND VOYAGE DATA MONITORING, HMON<br>
<br>
The Weir-Jones Group designs, builds and installs hull condition and motion monitoring systems for a variety of vessels and offshore structures.  A wide range of data display and storage options are available for these systems to meet the requirements of various classification societies eg. DNV Rules for classification of High Speed and Light Craft, Lloyds, ABS, Guide for hull Condition Monitoring Systems,  etc.  Specifically hull condition monitoring systems can be supplied which comply with the classification society requirements of the following areas:<br>
<br>
	- Hull Girder Stress				- Slam Warning<br>
	- Local Load Monitoring			- Green Seas Warning<br>
	- Ship motion					- Fatigue Monitoring<br>
<br>
In addition Voyage Data Monitoring, VDM, equipment can be provided which can acquire and store the data generated by the Hull Condition Monitoring Systems as well as other operational parameters including radar, and bridge/engine room voice communications, video feeds, etc.<br>
<br>
REAL-TIME WAVE HEIGHT MONITORING, WHAM<br>
<br>
The Weir-Jones Group has developed a system which provides the Masters of high speed vessels with information about the significant wave height that their vessels are encountering.  The information can be made available as a digital display on the bridge or it can be supplied to a Voyage Data Monitor.<br>

IV	PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
In addition to providing design and analytical services, the Weir-Jones Group has developed a range of proprietary products and systems designed to enhance the safety and cost-effective operation of various types of vessels.  These include:<br>
<br>
AUTOMATIC DRAUGHT INDICATOR SYSTEM - ADIS<br>
<br>
With the support and co-operation of the British Columbia Ferry Corporation, the Group developed an Automatic Draught Indicator System, ADIS, for commercial vessels.   The system has the following significant features:<br>
<br>
&amp;#8729;	No hull penetrations are required, and an installation can be completed in as little as 8 hours on existing vessels. <br>
&amp;#8729;	ADIS is significantly less costly than systems requiring hull penetration and is essentially maintenance free.  Mean time between failures exceeds 50,000 hrs.<br>
&amp;#8729;	ADIS can provide very accurate draught measurements during cargo loading.<br>
&amp;#8729;	ADIS provides real-time loading information about hogging, sagging and inclination.<br>
&amp;#8729;	The ADIS real-time digital bridge display shows the draught of the vessel, port and starboard, forward, amidships and aft with an accuracy of better than ±2 cm.<br>
<br>
B.C. Ferries operates one of the worlds largest ferry fleets and require an accurate, reliable and cost effective solution to their draught monitoring system needs. The ADIS system was designed to meet their specific requirements and it has proven to be extremely reliable during a ten vessel three year Beta test programme. This system is now available to marine operators as a commercial product with distribution and support available internationally.<br>
<br>
HULL CONDITION MONITORING SYSTEMS AND VOYAGE DATA MONITORING, HMON<br>
<br>
The Weir-Jones Group designs, builds and installs hull condition and motion monitoring systems for a variety of vessels and offshore structures.  A wide range of data display and storage options are available for these systems to meet the requirements of various classification societies eg. DNV Rules for classification of High Speed and Light Craft, Lloyds, ABS, Guide for hull Condition Monitoring Systems,  etc.  Specifically hull condition monitoring systems can be supplied which comply with the classification society requirements of the following areas:<br>
<br>
	- Hull Girder Stress				- Slam Warning<br>
	- Local Load Monitoring			- Green Seas Warning<br>
	- Ship motion					- Fatigue Monitoring<br>
<br>
In addition Voyage Data Monitoring, VDM, equipment can be provided which can acquire and store the data generated by the Hull Condition Monitoring Systems as well as other operational parameters including radar, and bridge/engine room voice communications, video feeds, etc.<br>
<br>
REAL-TIME WAVE HEIGHT MONITORING, WHAM<br>
<br>
The Weir-Jones Group has developed a system which provides the Masters of high speed vessels with information about the significant wave height that their vessels are encountering.  The information can be made available as a digital display on the bridge or it can be supplied to a Voyage Data Monitor.<br>
