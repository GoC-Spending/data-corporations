                            When conflict becomes entrenched, unrelenting, and gaining in momentum regardless of interventions aimed at resolution, it becomes essential to asses the root cause(s) of the difficulty and treat it. Akin to seeing a medical practitioner  we rarely look to treat just the symptoms but we typically want to know the cause of our symptoms and how to prevent it in the future.<br>
Situation assessments include the gathering of essential information and feedback, an analysis of the findings and a range of custom designed recommendations to rectify the situation. This blueprint provides clients with a summary of the issues needing attention and custom designed approaches to resolve the causal and emergent issues.<br>
Situational assessments for resolving conflict are successful in creating sustainable and lasting change in a range of organizations. These processes target the real issues and focus on recommendations that are relevant, practical and achievable. The guesswork is taken out of the picture and replaced with concrete next steps to rectify, resolve and shift the organization to a healthier dynamic with renewed focus on achieving better results for the organization.<br>

                            When conflict escalates and emotions take over, it becomes challenging for the parties involved to engage in meaningful dialogue with one another. Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process that supports two or more individuals to identify and reconcile differences, thus arriving at concrete agreements. Our trained and professional mediators work as objective neutral third parties assisting in the negotiation of differences. This assistance includes preparing the parties to speak with one another, managing the emotional dynamics during mediation, and ensuring a fair and effective process that gets to the real issues at hand.<br>
Mediation is a structured step-by step process that works well for family, workplace, and community matters. Amongst its many benefits, mediation is a process that is time efficient and therefore less costly than moving through legal channels. Mediation gives voice directly to the involved parties, thus giving them control over the resolution while also providing them with a buffer of support and reality checking. Results yielded from mediation are reported by participants as meaningful to them, realistic, and lasting with a high level of compliance. Furthermore, mediation processes are confidential and private.<br>
Mediation is also a flexible process for those difficult situations where face-to-face meetings are not possible due to the intensity of the situation. In these cases, our mediators assist in the resolution of differences by moving between the parties and assisting them to create an agreement that allows them to move forward from the conflict at hand. This allows participants to have added comfort while still resolving the situation.<br>

                            There are times when large groups require a process that allows all parties to come together and sort out their differences. When entire departments, organizations, or extended families find themselves collectively in a difficult situation, our consultants can assist by designing and leading large group sessions that are inclusive of all parties. Facilitated sessions allow the parties to communicate with one another while problem solving their issues, setting guidelines for future interactions, and engaging in strategic planning.<br>
Our consultants design the process with care. They strategically attend to the emotions in the room so that participants remain focused on resolving the issues and designing outcomes that are meaningful, realistic, and lasting.  Our goal is to provide a fair and balanced process to allow genuine dialogue and planning to occur.<br>
The process of facilitation is a flexible process tailored to meet the unique needs of each group. Key steps include: the group setting guidelines for communication during the session, a clear defining of the issues that need to be sorted out, and a combination of small and large group work to achieve resolution.<br>
The benefits of facilitation include the opportunity for everyone to have a voice in naming the issues and achieving resolution, thus increasing commitment to follow through with the agreements. Facilitation is also an efficient and effective way to move a large group forward in a cohesive manner with an agreed upon plan.  Relationships are often solidified and greater understanding is achieved. The financial costs are minimal and the rewards are long lasting.<br>

                            Large group training can provide us with great insights in effective leadership skills, conflict resolution strategies, and communication approaches, however, group training is not ideal for all of us. Many individuals report greater success and integration from personalized individual support in a private setting. One to one coaching allows you to analyze your leadership, conflict resolution, and communication approaches in a confidential and highly supportive environment without peering eyes.<br>
We provide in person, on the telephone and web based leadership, conflict resolution and communication coaching. We build strong relationships with our clients and provide clear, direct and digestible feedback to help individuals create change in their personal and professional lives.<br>
We custom design coaching processes with each client to ensure all areas of need are addressed and in a manner that fits best for the client. Leadership, conflict resolution and communication coaching processes can include shadowing (direct observation by the coach), communication and awareness building exercises, opportunities to practice newly acquired strategies, concrete in-the moment feedback, analysis of difficult situations, and growth measurement.<br>

              </h4>
          
              Right from our first contact with Turning Point Resolutions we received personalized attention and care. There was never a feeling of being second to any other client. We worked with many members of their team including a conflict analyst, communication coach and a mediator. The consistency was never lost though. Each one had the perfect specialized skill set for what we needed and whats more, they had a genuine desire to help us.&quot;<br>

&quot;Turning Point Resolutions not only helped our school staff understand our barriers and differences as a team, but also really opened our eyes to our potential and strengths. Understanding what was holding our team back allowed us to look at why we become educators, who we serve and how to get back to making a difference in public education.&quot;<br>
Jeff W., Youth and Childcare Worker, Greater Vancouver<br>
<br>
&quot;The region contracted with Turning Point Resolutions to engage in mediation services to mediate employee to employee and employee to management conflict. The TPR expert was professional and understood the sensitivity and complexity of the situations particularly in a union environment. The meditations were successful as the parties involved reached resolution and were able to move forward with their relationships in a positive and cooperative manner.&quot;<br>

We were having so many issues and we just couldn&#39;t sit down and resolve them as a couple. With strategy and care Turning Point Resolutions helped us talk through our issues and find our compassion for each other again.&quot;<br>
Wendy and Jason P., Entrepreneurs, Victoria<br>
<br>
&quot;TPR scaffolded the learning in a manageable and constructive manner that allowed me to maximize my understanding and skill building. I would recommend their training for any person in a position that requires productive interactions with others.&quot;<br>
Gerry B., Director of Instruction, British Columbia<br>
<br>
&quot;We needed an opportunity to get the key players in our complex into the same room to resolve issues before it became too difficult to live on the same site. Turning Point Resolutions helped us come together, define the problems we needed to sort out and then actually sort them out. Our TPR expert managed the emotions in the room, kept us focused and helped us come up with solutions. It was such a positive experience that members of our strata team hired TPR to facilitate problem solving in their worksites.&quot;<br>
Strata Council, Regina<br>
<br>
I knew how to connect with my daughter until she became a teenager. I no longer had any idea how to communicate with her. Whatever I said just further frustrated her. TPR helped me tweak and adjust my communication so that I could let go of unnecessary arguments and actually have positive interactions with my daughter.&quot;<br>
Elizabeth C., Abbotsford<br>
<br>
When I started working with TPR, I was told that one day I would easily be able to stand back, focus on what was going on with me and the other person, and respond rationally in challenging situations. At the time, I was struggling with the effects of being overly stressed and immersed in numerous conflicts and I couldn&#39;t even imagine that possibility. With compassion, TPR provided me with the tools to effectively manage stress and respond to conflict rather than react impulsively. The more I use these tools the more natural my responses are and the stronger my relationships have become.&quot;<br>
Cynthia B., Special Education Teacher, Newberg, Oregon<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the best, most practical workshops I have ever attended.&quot;<br>
Ward B., Department of Justice<br>
<br>
&quot;Knowledge, the ability to work with adult learners and the ability to engage the group in meaningful work is truly a strength of Turning Point Resolutions.&quot;<br>

&quot;Impeccable, precise, and simplistic delivery within just the right time frame&quot;<br>

                            When conflict becomes entrenched, unrelenting, and gaining in momentum regardless of interventions aimed at resolution, it becomes essential to asses the root cause(s) of the difficulty and treat it. Akin to seeing a medical practitioner  we rarely look to treat just the symptoms but we typically want to know the cause of our symptoms and how to prevent it in the future.<br>
Situation assessments include the gathering of essential information and feedback, an analysis of the findings and a range of custom designed recommendations to rectify the situation. This blueprint provides clients with a summary of the issues needing attention and custom designed approaches to resolve the causal and emergent issues.<br>
Situational assessments for resolving conflict are successful in creating sustainable and lasting change in a range of organizations. These processes target the real issues and focus on recommendations that are relevant, practical and achievable. The guesswork is taken out of the picture and replaced with concrete next steps to rectify, resolve and shift the organization to a healthier dynamic with renewed focus on achieving better results for the organization.<br>

                            When conflict escalates and emotions take over, it becomes challenging for the parties involved to engage in meaningful dialogue with one another. Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process that supports two or more individuals to identify and reconcile differences, thus arriving at concrete agreements. Our trained and professional mediators work as objective neutral third parties assisting in the negotiation of differences. This assistance includes preparing the parties to speak with one another, managing the emotional dynamics during mediation, and ensuring a fair and effective process that gets to the real issues at hand.<br>
Mediation is a structured step-by step process that works well for family, workplace, and community matters. Amongst its many benefits, mediation is a process that is time efficient and therefore less costly than moving through legal channels. Mediation gives voice directly to the involved parties, thus giving them control over the resolution while also providing them with a buffer of support and reality checking. Results yielded from mediation are reported by participants as meaningful to them, realistic, and lasting with a high level of compliance. Furthermore, mediation processes are confidential and private.<br>
Mediation is also a flexible process for those difficult situations where face-to-face meetings are not possible due to the intensity of the situation. In these cases, our mediators assist in the resolution of differences by moving between the parties and assisting them to create an agreement that allows them to move forward from the conflict at hand. This allows participants to have added comfort while still resolving the situation.<br>

                            There are times when large groups require a process that allows all parties to come together and sort out their differences. When entire departments, organizations, or extended families find themselves collectively in a difficult situation, our consultants can assist by designing and leading large group sessions that are inclusive of all parties. Facilitated sessions allow the parties to communicate with one another while problem solving their issues, setting guidelines for future interactions, and engaging in strategic planning.<br>
Our consultants design the process with care. They strategically attend to the emotions in the room so that participants remain focused on resolving the issues and designing outcomes that are meaningful, realistic, and lasting.  Our goal is to provide a fair and balanced process to allow genuine dialogue and planning to occur.<br>
The process of facilitation is a flexible process tailored to meet the unique needs of each group. Key steps include: the group setting guidelines for communication during the session, a clear defining of the issues that need to be sorted out, and a combination of small and large group work to achieve resolution.<br>
The benefits of facilitation include the opportunity for everyone to have a voice in naming the issues and achieving resolution, thus increasing commitment to follow through with the agreements. Facilitation is also an efficient and effective way to move a large group forward in a cohesive manner with an agreed upon plan.  Relationships are often solidified and greater understanding is achieved. The financial costs are minimal and the rewards are long lasting.<br>

                            Large group training can provide us with great insights in effective leadership skills, conflict resolution strategies, and communication approaches, however, group training is not ideal for all of us. Many individuals report greater success and integration from personalized individual support in a private setting. One to one coaching allows you to analyze your leadership, conflict resolution, and communication approaches in a confidential and highly supportive environment without peering eyes.<br>
We provide in person, on the telephone and web based leadership, conflict resolution and communication coaching. We build strong relationships with our clients and provide clear, direct and digestible feedback to help individuals create change in their personal and professional lives.<br>
We custom design coaching processes with each client to ensure all areas of need are addressed and in a manner that fits best for the client. Leadership, conflict resolution and communication coaching processes can include shadowing (direct observation by the coach), communication and awareness building exercises, opportunities to practice newly acquired strategies, concrete in-the moment feedback, analysis of difficult situations, and growth measurement.<br>

                Testimonial:
              </h4>
          
              Right from our first contact with Turning Point Resolutions we received personalized attention and care. There was never a feeling of being second to any other client. We worked with many members of their team including a conflict analyst, communication coach and a mediator. The consistency was never lost though. Each one had the perfect specialized skill set for what we needed and whats more, they had a genuine desire to help us.&quot;<br>
Vice President, HR Services,<br>
British Columbia Hospital<br>
<br>
&quot;Turning Point Resolutions not only helped our school staff understand our barriers and differences as a team, but also really opened our eyes to our potential and strengths. Understanding what was holding our team back allowed us to look at why we become educators, who we serve and how to get back to making a difference in public education.&quot;<br>
Jeff W., Youth and Childcare Worker, Greater Vancouver<br>
<br>
&quot;The region contracted with Turning Point Resolutions to engage in mediation services to mediate employee to employee and employee to management conflict. The TPR expert was professional and understood the sensitivity and complexity of the situations particularly in a union environment. The meditations were successful as the parties involved reached resolution and were able to move forward with their relationships in a positive and cooperative manner.&quot;<br>
Jean K., Manager of Field Services, Vancouver<br>
<br>
We were having so many issues and we just couldn&#39;t sit down and resolve them as a couple. With strategy and care Turning Point Resolutions helped us talk through our issues and find our compassion for each other again.&quot;<br>
Wendy and Jason P., Entrepreneurs, Victoria<br>
<br>
&quot;TPR scaffolded the learning in a manageable and constructive manner that allowed me to maximize my understanding and skill building. I would recommend their training for any person in a position that requires productive interactions with others.&quot;<br>
Gerry B., Director of Instruction, British Columbia<br>
<br>
&quot;We needed an opportunity to get the key players in our complex into the same room to resolve issues before it became too difficult to live on the same site. Turning Point Resolutions helped us come together, define the problems we needed to sort out and then actually sort them out. Our TPR expert managed the emotions in the room, kept us focused and helped us come up with solutions. It was such a positive experience that members of our strata team hired TPR to facilitate problem solving in their worksites.&quot;<br>
Strata Council, Regina<br>
<br>
I knew how to connect with my daughter until she became a teenager. I no longer had any idea how to communicate with her. Whatever I said just further frustrated her. TPR helped me tweak and adjust my communication so that I could let go of unnecessary arguments and actually have positive interactions with my daughter.&quot;<br>
Elizabeth C., Abbotsford<br>
<br>
When I started working with TPR, I was told that one day I would easily be able to stand back, focus on what was going on with me and the other person, and respond rationally in challenging situations. At the time, I was struggling with the effects of being overly stressed and immersed in numerous conflicts and I couldn&#39;t even imagine that possibility. With compassion, TPR provided me with the tools to effectively manage stress and respond to conflict rather than react impulsively. The more I use these tools the more natural my responses are and the stronger my relationships have become.&quot;<br>
Cynthia B., Special Education Teacher, Newberg, Oregon<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the best, most practical workshops I have ever attended.&quot;<br>
Ward B., Department of Justice<br>
<br>
&quot;Knowledge, the ability to work with adult learners and the ability to engage the group in meaningful work is truly a strength of Turning Point Resolutions.&quot;<br>
Bob G., School Principal, Kelowna<br>
<br>
&quot;Impeccable, precise, and simplistic delivery within just the right time frame&quot;<br>
