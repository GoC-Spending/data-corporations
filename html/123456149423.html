The TerraLens layered display approach allows developers to layer map data with multiple sources of geospatial data to craft complex situational displays. The system incorporates data from multiple sources, including real-time data feeds, databases, maps and images. Any number of data sources can be visually fused in the situation display, independent of their source.<br>
<br>
TerraLens lets developers fully customize all elements of their application display and interface, while providing real-time performance and extreme precision. Using OpenGL context sharing, TerraLens views can be displayed as part of a composite image, allowing for complete customization of the user interface. TerraLens Core can easily be integrated with an existing application, and is compatible with most GUI toolkits, including Qt, Qt Quick, QML, and Java.<br>
<br>
TerraLens is standards-based, and platform independent, and includes libraries, documentation, and sample code for most operating systems and multiple development environments.<br>
<br>
Deploy to multiple Form Factors<br>
<br>
TerraLens supports more platforms, operating systems, and form factors than any other mapping SDK or geospatial library. With TerraLens, you can easily deploy your application to multiple platforms and form factors, and be confident of the same standard of performance – whether your application is running on a desktop, tablet, smart phone, or dedicated hardware.<br>
<br>
Reduce Implementation Risk and Cost<br>
<br>
Reduce development cost and implementation risk with a platform that has been proven in hundreds of vital systems and applications, with industry-leading support for a broad range of platforms, operating systems, and development environments.

                            About IRIS UAS<br>
<br>
IRIS UAS is a situational awareness platform developed to provide Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operators with the necessary situational awareness to safely operate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLOS). The platform presents users with 2D and 3D map and terrain data, aeronautical information such as aerodrome locations, obstacles and airspace, and real-time data from sensors, cameras, and weather data sources - all integrated within a single, common operating picture display that’s easy to use, and customizable on a per-mission basis.<br>
<br>
A Common Operating Picture for BVLOS Operations<br>
<br>
As the Commercial UAS sector matures, the need to conduct BVLOS operations in non-segregated airspace is becoming increasingly acute. The IRIS UAS platform greatly enhances the situational awareness of UAS operators in BVLOS operations by presenting a single situational awareness display that aggregates and presents a broad array of external and ownship information sources. These are information sources that are not normally available or presented to a UAS operator by typical Ground Control Station (GCS) displays.<br>
<br>
By consolidating this information and making it easily accessible to the UAS operator, IRIS UAS helps assist the operator in recognizing flight risks and choosing the safest course of action while the UAS is operating at BVLOS ranges.<br>
<br>
In addition to aeronautical information, the platform aggregates and displays real-time data feeds of airborne traffic in proximity to the UAS, such as ADS-B data or Air Traffic Management (ATM) radar feeds, as well as live weather data.<br>
<br>
This combined display is highly intuitive, and allows for dramatically improved airspace situational awareness - even when the UAS is under direct observation.<br>
<br>
Utilizing these data sources IRIS UAS calculates and displays warnings, alerts and cues to the UAS operator to maintain traffic separation and avoidance. IRIS UAS has been demonstrated to be more effective than direct visual observation when tested in a series of operational flight trials in collision avoidance scenarios1.<br>
<br>
Ready to Integrate with Your UAS<br>
<br>
IRIS UAS is Ground Control Station (GCS) and Autopilot agnostic, and can be deployed on a variety of form factors, depending on the nature of the platform and the operational requirements of the mission. The IRIS UAS display can be deployed on a tablet to augment a handheld GCS or on a laptop as part of a desktop BVLOS GCS for applications such as emergency response and search and rescue; or even deployed on a tower or rack-mounted server as a component of a full-fledged UAS operations centre. IRIS UAS will be participating in the NASA UTM Phase 2 demonstrations in fall 2016.<br>
<br>
Intuitive, Touch-Driven Control<br>
<br>
The IRIS UAS platform is built around an innovative, touch-driven user interface that allows operators to easily visualize and manage multiple data feeds. Live mission and aeronautical data can be displayed as user-customizable layers on 2D and 3D maps, while additional data feeds from cameras and other sensors are shown as a series of small “display cards” within the interface. Users can swap the displays by simply dragging display cards into the main viewing area. UAS operators can control the pan, zoom, and tilt of the operational picture with multi-touch gestures, or simply set the map to follow their ownship position from a variety of preconfigured perspectives.<br>
<br>
Cloud Integration for Data and Reporting<br>
<br>
IRIS UAS includes cloud integration for mission planning, updating and reporting purposes. A cloud-based application provides access to aeronautical data provided by the FAA and NAV Canada for mission planning purposes, and provides an easy way to store a mission file - both as a flight data recorder function and for any Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) analysis by the operator.<br>
<br>
Built on Operational Experience<br>
<br>
When engineering IRIS UAS, Kongsberg Geospatial leveraged over 30 years of development of ATM displays used world-wide and over 10 years of experience in developing situational awareness software for military UAS programs including the Northrop Grumman Triton Global Hawk.<br>
<br>
The resulting platform is a uniquely mature, flexible system that provides a wealth of critical, real-time data in a deceptively simple touch-driven interface that includes common Command and Control functions.<br>
<br>
The clean, customizable user interface makes it simple enough for UAS operators to use with minimal training. Kongsberg Geospatial is currently flight testing IRIS UAS for BVLOS operations with industry and regulatory partners, and as part of training exercises with emergency response services to gather and incorporate valuable user feedback.<br>

                            About I-SIM<br>
<br>
Originally developed for the FAA as the Air Traffic Control Advanced Research Simulator (ATCARS), I-SIM today is a commercially available simulation system used for Air Traffic Control Training, Air Space design/analysis, advanced CHI/HMI development, and to support UAS integration into civil airspace.<br>
<br>
The I-SIM system is a high fidelity radar simulation system which supports both en-route and terminal operations. The system is delivered with fully functional ERAM and ARTS/STARS display applications.<br>
<br>
These display applications have been thoroughly tested and evaluated at some of the country’s largest and busiest facilities including SoCal, Phoenix, Cleveland / Detroit, Denver, and Florida Metroxplex sites, and recently for the Atlantic Coast Route Program for ZBW, ZDC, ZNY, ZJX, and ZMA.<br>
<br>
The I-SIm Embedded Trainer application was completed and delivered to the USN and deployed on the first ship in 2016. Air Traffic Control training on USN Aircraft Carriers will now be carried out on newly installed I-SIM systems.<br>
<br>
Unsurpassed Fidelity<br>
<br>
I-SIM is the leading platform for ATC training. I-SIM reproduces ERAM and ARTS/STARS applications, airspaces, and user interfaces with absolute fidelity of the actual working systems. When used in conjunction with modified ERAM/STARS keyboards and I/O devices, the I-SIM system simulates actual NAS systems with unsurpassed accuracy and fidelity.<br>
<br>
Support for Multiple Data Formats<br>
<br>
I-SIM is unique in its ability to import multiple data formats for use in simulation scenarios. Among others, I-SIM supports the FAA Performance Data Analysis Reporting System (PDARS) format, and can leverage actual traffic data as the building blocks to explore “what if?” scenarios for evaluating airspace changes and design concepts, or for developing immediate scenarios for training purposes.<br>
<br>
The system is flexible, and is capable of replaying and simulating any combination of en route and terminal operations simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Computer-Human Interface (CHI) Development Tools<br>
<br>
I-SIM includes additional software tools to modify, add, investigate, research and build Computer-Human Interface (CHI or HMI) changes to both ARTS/STARS and ERAM systems. Currently, the FAA is conducting Human Factors Engineering on prototype workstations and investigating automation tools for use in the next generation NAS system. Evaluations by controllers are made easier by allowing changes to the CHI/HMI to be assessed during prototyping sessions with immediate feedback.<br>
<br>
I-SIM can be deployed on any Windows OS computer and is scalable from one to any number of working positions with simultaneous en-route and terminal operations.<br>
<br>
When delivered as a system, I-SIM includes Pilot Positions and a Supervisor/Instructor position which manages the simulation exercise. The system includes both RADAR (R) and Data (D) positions when operated in an en-route configuration. Any position in the system can run on a laptop computer which is especially useful when running remote operations and/or mobile configurations.<br>
<br>
Additional I-SIM Modules:<br>
<br>
I-SIM Connect (voice communication system simulator)<br>
<br>
I-SIM Connect gives you the flexibility to simulate authentic voice-control communication between controllers and pilots, in an environment incorporating virtually every feature of today’s most common VCS systems.<br>
<br>
I-SIM Connect employs advanced VOIP technology to minimize cost and leverage existing infrastructure.<br>
<br>
I-SIM VRR<br>
<br>
I-SIM VRR provides an automated alternative for live pseudo-pilot operators when used in ATM/ATC training.<br>
<br>
I-SIM VRR accepts verbal commands from the air traffic controller and executes them as the aircraft should, providing voice responses to the operator as it does so. The VRR module requires very little voice recognition “training” when being used by a new operator, and provides nearly 98% comprehension of voice commands with most operators out of the box.<br>
<br>
I-SIM VRR is a useful tool for training environments where there is limited space or personnel, and is currently in-use as part of the Air Traffic Control Training System on U.S. Navy Aircraft Carriers.<br>

                            About the ISR Viewer Big Data Visualization Platform<br>
<br>
ISR Viewer is a flexible, thin-client platform built on the TerraLens Web framework. The ISR Viewer platform couples with a broad range of data sources to allow analysts to quickly and easily visualize complex big data sources in both a geospatial and a temporal context. The platform includes a variety of analytical tools, including heat-mapping and a virtual DVR for data animation over time.<br>
<br>
With the ISR Viewer platform, both military and civilian analysts can more easily make sense of complex data sets - even data originating from unstructured and open-source feeds like social media channels.<br>
<br>
The ISR viewer can consume map tiles from TerraLens Server, or from a variety of other standards-based map tile servers, and since it’s a thin client application, it can be deployed on a variety of form factors, including tablets and mobile devices.<br>
<br>
With ISR Viewer, analysts can view layers of open source or classified data in a common operating picture. The platform includes a common network connector API which allows any data source to be retrieved and displayed with temporal and spatial metadata in a map.<br>
<br>
The DVR-style data animation playback capability allows analysts to animate massive data sets to see the progression of intelligence reports and incidents as they progress in time and space. The platform has been successfully deployed with a variety of data platforms, including the Kongsberg AGS System Master Archival/Retrieval Facility (SMARF).<br>
<br>
Visualize Big Data Sets in a Geospatial and Temporal Context<br>
<br>
In addition to providing core mapping capabilities for thin client applications, TerraLens Web provides a web-based intelligence data visualization toolkit that allows operators to gather varied open and classified data in a searchable framework. With TerraLens Web, analysts can display and visualize multiple types of data feeds, including:<br>
<br>
- HUMINT - Files, video, Document, Biometric<br>
- SIGINT – Tracks, bearing, RF strength, frequency<br>
- OSINT – html files, images, email, social media feeds<br>
- Full Motion Video<br>
- Commercial Maritime AIS or aviation ADSB<br>
<br>
The integrated data animation and heat-mapping features can help analysts understand how situations on the ground evolve, and to help identify patterns that might otherwise be lost in the noise of big data sets. This correlation of geographic and temporal data presents a tremendously powerful new paradigm for big data analysis.<br>

              Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar <br>
<br>
Developed for the United States Marine Corps, the AN/TPS-80 Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) is a multifunction system designed to replace five legacy radar systems currently in use by the Marine Corps. <br>
<br>
As a specialist in the development of Human Machine Interfaces, Kongsberg Gallium was selected by the prime contractor to design and build the Situational Display. Working in close cooperation with the customer, the system is designed and built with an open, scalable architecture to enable digital interoperability, providing the flexibility and power to deal with complex situations. <br>
<br>
<br>
NATO AWACS <br>
<br>
NATOs Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) surveillance aircraft feature radars and other sensors which cover over 120,000 square miles. This wide range results in a massive amount of information that must be displayed and presented, and places significant requirements on both the system performance and architecture. <br>
<br>
One of the most critical requirements for NATO AWACS is the ability to manage over ten thousand items simultaneously while maintaining ease of use. Kongsberg Gallium was chosen as a result of our proven capability to develop reliable and high performance Human Machine Interface (HMI) solutions. <br>
<br>
<br>
Joint Battle Command-Platform <br>
<br>
The U.S. Army Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) is the next generation of the existing Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Joint Capabilities Release. Among the key areas of improvement required are a more intuitive graphical user interface, improved display of maps and images, and increased performance. <br>
<br>
Utilizing smartphone-like technology, dismounted soldiers are able to track friendly forces and vehicles, access Mission Command applications, and input and share battlefield information such as the location of threats. Features similar to those found in commercial devices, such as touch to zoom maps and drag and drop icons, are intuitive to learn and easy to use in the field.

                            TerraLens (formerly InterMAPhics) is a high performance, real-time geospatial software development tool kit (SDK). TerraLens provides a rich feature set for mapping, spatial awareness, ISR, Air Traffic, and Command and Control (C2) applications, and has been fielded in some of the most demanding, mission-critical systems and platforms in the world.<br>
<br>
TerraLens has been the market leading geospatial platform for mission-critical applications for nearly three decades. The platform has been tried and proven in solutions for air-traffic control, ISR, and air defense.<br>
<br>
The TerraLens platform includes the following products:<br>
<br>
1) TerraLens Core - Easily add geospatial capabilities to your software with this powerful library and SDK<br>
<br>
2) TerraLens Server - Serve a wide array of map tile formats to thin or thick client applications<br>
<br>
3) TerraLens Mobile - Easily add mapping and spatial awareness capabilities to your Android applications with this library and SDK<br>
<br>
4) TerraLens Creator - Automate the assembly of map sets, style your maps, and add symbology and other assets quickly with this feature-rich application<br>
<br>
5) TerraLens Web - Quickly add geospatial and data visualization capabilities to browser-based applications with this powerful, flexible open-standards foundation<br>
<br>
6) TerraLens UI - Accelerate your application development with an application framework and foundation that includes sophisticated multi-touch features<br>
<br>
<br>
What Makes TerraLens Different<br>
<br>
If you think all mapping and geospatial software is the same, consider this: when major systems integrators like Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, and Raytheon needed geospatial components for mission-critical defense platforms, they chose TerraLens because of its proven reliability and performance.<br>
<br>
TerraLens is also the leading platform for air traffic control, (ATM/ATC) applications, and has been deployed in air traffic systems all over the world. In some applications, TerraLens Core components have been in continuous operation for over two decades.<br>
<br>
Deliver Reliable Performance and Reduce Project Risk<br>
<br>
TerraLens reduces the risk and complexity of application development by providing a comprehensive API that transforms low-level platform graphics into a powerful, full-featured situational display engine.<br>
<br>
Developers can leverage a mature, purpose-built API to deliver the features and performance they need, instead of having to develop a display framework from scratch. The TerraLens Core API has been evolved and tested over decades of development, and includes hundreds of powerful features that meet the most exacting operating requirements. This allows your team to focus on your system-unique requirements, significantly reducing development time, and project risks.<br>
<br>
The Flexibility You Need<br>
<br>
The TerraLens layered display approach allows developers to layer map data with multiple sources of geospatial data to craft complex situational displays. The system incorporates data from multiple sources, including real-time data feeds, databases, maps and images. Any number of data sources can be visually fused in the situation display, independent of their source.<br>
<br>
TerraLens lets developers fully customize all elements of their application display and interface, while providing real-time performance and extreme precision. Using OpenGL context sharing, TerraLens views can be displayed as part of a composite image, allowing for complete customization of the user interface.

                            About IRIS UAS<br>
<br>
IRIS UAS is a situational awareness platform developed to provide Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operators with the necessary situational awareness to safely operate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLOS). The platform presents users with 2D and 3D map and terrain data, aeronautical information such as aerodrome locations, obstacles and airspace, and real-time data from sensors, cameras, and weather data sources - all integrated within a single, common operating picture display that’s easy to use, and customizable on a per-mission basis.<br>
<br>
A Common Operating Picture for BVLOS Operations<br>
<br>
As the Commercial UAS sector matures, the need to conduct BVLOS operations in non-segregated airspace is becoming increasingly acute. The IRIS UAS platform greatly enhances the situational awareness of UAS operators in BVLOS operations by presenting a single situational awareness display that aggregates and presents a broad array of external and ownship information sources. These are information sources that are not normally available or presented to a UAS operator by typical Ground Control Station (GCS) displays.<br>
<br>
By consolidating this information and making it easily accessible to the UAS operator, IRIS UAS helps assist the operator in recognizing flight risks and choosing the safest course of action while the UAS is operating at BVLOS ranges.<br>
<br>
In addition to aeronautical information, the platform aggregates and displays real-time data feeds of airborne traffic in proximity to the UAS, such as ADS-B data or Air Traffic Management (ATM) radar feeds, as well as live weather data.<br>
<br>
This combined display is highly intuitive, and allows for dramatically improved airspace situational awareness - even when the UAS is under direct observation.<br>
<br>
Utilizing these data sources IRIS UAS calculates and displays warnings, alerts and cues to the UAS operator to maintain traffic separation and avoidance. IRIS UAS has been demonstrated to be more effective than direct visual observation when tested in a series of operational flight trials in collision avoidance scenarios1.<br>
<br>
Ready to Integrate with Your UAS<br>
<br>
IRIS UAS is Ground Control Station (GCS) and Autopilot agnostic, and can be deployed on a variety of form factors, depending on the nature of the platform and the operational requirements of the mission. The IRIS UAS display can be deployed on a tablet to augment a handheld GCS or on a laptop as part of a desktop BVLOS GCS for applications such as emergency response and search and rescue; or even deployed on a tower or rack-mounted server as a component of a full-fledged UAS operations centre. IRIS UAS will be participating in the NASA UTM Phase 2 demonstrations in fall 2016.<br>
<br>
Intuitive, Touch-Driven Control<br>
<br>
The IRIS UAS platform is built around an innovative, touch-driven user interface that allows operators to easily visualize and manage multiple data feeds. Live mission and aeronautical data can be displayed as user-customizable layers on 2D and 3D maps, while additional data feeds from cameras and other sensors are shown as a series of small “display cards” within the interface. Users can swap the displays by simply dragging display cards into the main viewing area. UAS operators can control the pan, zoom, and tilt of the operational picture with multi-touch gestures, or simply set the map to follow their ownship position from a variety of preconfigured perspectives.<br>
<br>
Cloud Integration for Data and Reporting<br>
<br>
IRIS UAS includes cloud integration for mission planning, updating and reporting purposes. A cloud-based application provides access to aeronautical data provided by the FAA and NAV Canada for mission planning purposes, and provides an easy way to store a mission file - both as a flight data recorder function and for any Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) analysis by the operator.<br>
<br>
Built on Operational Experience<br>
<br>
When engineering IRIS UAS, Kongsberg Geospatial leveraged over 30 years of development of ATM displays used world-wide and over 10 years of experience in developing situational awareness software for military UAS programs including the Northrop Grumman Triton Global Hawk.<br>
<br>
The resulting platform is a uniquely mature, flexible system that provides a wealth of critical, real-time data in a deceptively simple touch-driven interface that includes common Command and Control functions.<br>
<br>
The clean, customizable user interface makes it simple enough for UAS operators to use with minimal training. Kongsberg Geospatial is currently flight testing IRIS UAS for BVLOS operations with industry and regulatory partners, and as part of training exercises with emergency response services to gather and incorporate valuable user feedback.<br>

                            About I-SIM<br>
<br>
Originally developed for the FAA as the Air Traffic Control Advanced Research Simulator (ATCARS), I-SIM today is a commercially available simulation system used for Air Traffic Control Training, Air Space design/analysis, advanced CHI/HMI development, and to support UAS integration into civil airspace.<br>
<br>
The I-SIM system is a high fidelity radar simulation system which supports both en-route and terminal operations. The system is delivered with fully functional ERAM and ARTS/STARS display applications.<br>
<br>
These display applications have been thoroughly tested and evaluated at some of the country’s largest and busiest facilities including SoCal, Phoenix, Cleveland / Detroit, Denver, and Florida Metroxplex sites, and recently for the Atlantic Coast Route Program for ZBW, ZDC, ZNY, ZJX, and ZMA.<br>
<br>
The I-SIm Embedded Trainer application was completed and delivered to the USN and deployed on the first ship in 2016. Air Traffic Control training on USN Aircraft Carriers will now be carried out on newly installed I-SIM systems.<br>
<br>
Unsurpassed Fidelity<br>
<br>
I-SIM is the leading platform for ATC training. I-SIM reproduces ERAM and ARTS/STARS applications, airspaces, and user interfaces with absolute fidelity of the actual working systems. When used in conjunction with modified ERAM/STARS keyboards and I/O devices, the I-SIM system simulates actual NAS systems with unsurpassed accuracy and fidelity.<br>
<br>
Support for Multiple Data Formats<br>
<br>
I-SIM is unique in its ability to import multiple data formats for use in simulation scenarios. Among others, I-SIM supports the FAA Performance Data Analysis Reporting System (PDARS) format, and can leverage actual traffic data as the building blocks to explore “what if?” scenarios for evaluating airspace changes and design concepts, or for developing immediate scenarios for training purposes.<br>
<br>
The system is flexible, and is capable of replaying and simulating any combination of en route and terminal operations simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Computer-Human Interface (CHI) Development Tools<br>
<br>
I-SIM includes additional software tools to modify, add, investigate, research and build Computer-Human Interface (CHI or HMI) changes to both ARTS/STARS and ERAM systems. Currently, the FAA is conducting Human Factors Engineering on prototype workstations and investigating automation tools for use in the next generation NAS system. Evaluations by controllers are made easier by allowing changes to the CHI/HMI to be assessed during prototyping sessions with immediate feedback.<br>
<br>
I-SIM can be deployed on any Windows OS computer and is scalable from one to any number of working positions with simultaneous en-route and terminal operations.<br>
<br>
When delivered as a system, I-SIM includes Pilot Positions and a Supervisor/Instructor position which manages the simulation exercise. The system includes both RADAR (R) and Data (D) positions when operated in an en-route configuration. Any position in the system can run on a laptop computer which is especially useful when running remote operations and/or mobile configurations.<br>
<br>
Additional I-SIM Modules:<br>
<br>
I-SIM Connect (voice communication system simulator)<br>
<br>
I-SIM Connect gives you the flexibility to simulate authentic voice-control communication between controllers and pilots, in an environment incorporating virtually every feature of today’s most common VCS systems.<br>
<br>
I-SIM Connect employs advanced VOIP technology to minimize cost and leverage existing infrastructure.<br>
<br>
I-SIM VRR<br>
<br>
I-SIM VRR provides an automated alternative for live pseudo-pilot operators when used in ATM/ATC training.<br>
<br>
I-SIM VRR accepts verbal commands from the air traffic controller and executes them as the aircraft should, providing voice responses to the operator as it does so. The VRR module requires very little voice recognition “training” when being used by a new operator, and provides nearly 98% comprehension of voice commands with most operators out of the box.<br>
<br>
I-SIM VRR is a useful tool for training environments where there is limited space or personnel, and is currently in-use as part of the Air Traffic Control Training System on U.S. Navy Aircraft Carriers.<br>

                            About the ISR Viewer Big Data Visualization Platform<br>
<br>
ISR Viewer is a flexible, thin-client platform built on the TerraLens Web framework. The ISR Viewer platform couples with a broad range of data sources to allow analysts to quickly and easily visualize complex big data sources in both a geospatial and a temporal context. The platform includes a variety of analytical tools, including heat-mapping and a virtual DVR for data animation over time.<br>
<br>
With the ISR Viewer platform, both military and civilian analysts can more easily make sense of complex data sets - even data originating from unstructured and open-source feeds like social media channels.<br>
<br>
The ISR viewer can consume map tiles from TerraLens Server, or from a variety of other standards-based map tile servers, and since it’s a thin client application, it can be deployed on a variety of form factors, including tablets and mobile devices.<br>
<br>
With ISR Viewer, analysts can view layers of open source or classified data in a common operating picture. The platform includes a common network connector API which allows any data source to be retrieved and displayed with temporal and spatial metadata in a map.<br>
<br>
The DVR-style data animation playback capability allows analysts to animate massive data sets to see the progression of intelligence reports and incidents as they progress in time and space. The platform has been successfully deployed with a variety of data platforms, including the Kongsberg AGS System Master Archival/Retrieval Facility (SMARF).<br>
<br>
Visualize Big Data Sets in a Geospatial and Temporal Context<br>
<br>
In addition to providing core mapping capabilities for thin client applications, TerraLens Web provides a web-based intelligence data visualization toolkit that allows operators to gather varied open and classified data in a searchable framework. With TerraLens Web, analysts can display and visualize multiple types of data feeds, including:<br>
<br>
- HUMINT - Files, video, Document, Biometric<br>
- SIGINT – Tracks, bearing, RF strength, frequency<br>
- OSINT – html files, images, email, social media feeds<br>
- Full Motion Video<br>
- Commercial Maritime AIS or aviation ADSB<br>
<br>
The integrated data animation and heat-mapping features can help analysts understand how situations on the ground evolve, and to help identify patterns that might otherwise be lost in the noise of big data sets. This correlation of geographic and temporal data presents a tremendously powerful new paradigm for big data analysis.<br>
<br>
Features<br>
<br>
- Intuitive web based UI with multi-touch support<br>
- Open layers geospatial web engine<br>
- Open standards based (non proprietary)<br>
- Responsive UI supports many viewport sizes<br>
- Heavy processing on host server<br>
- Lightweight client<br>
<br>
Modular Design Facilitates Feature Integration<br>
<br>
The ISR Viewer application features a modular design to help facilitate the addition of new features and functionality. The application can easily modified to provide new features and functionality as dictated by your project requirements, or even integrated into an existing browser-based application.<br>

              Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar <br>
<br>
Developed for the United States Marine Corps, the AN/TPS-80 Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) is a multifunction system designed to replace five legacy radar systems currently in use by the Marine Corps. <br>
<br>
As a specialist in the development of Human Machine Interfaces, Kongsberg Gallium was selected by the prime contractor to design and build the Situational Display. Working in close cooperation with the customer, the system is designed and built with an open, scalable architecture to enable digital interoperability, providing the flexibility and power to deal with complex situations. <br>
<br>
<br>
NATO AWACS <br>
<br>
NATOs Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) surveillance aircraft feature radars and other sensors which cover over 120,000 square miles. This wide range results in a massive amount of information that must be displayed and presented, and places significant requirements on both the system performance and architecture. <br>
<br>
One of the most critical requirements for NATO AWACS is the ability to manage over ten thousand items simultaneously while maintaining ease of use. Kongsberg Gallium was chosen as a result of our proven capability to develop reliable and high performance Human Machine Interface (HMI) solutions. <br>
<br>
<br>
Joint Battle Command-Platform <br>
<br>
The U.S. Army Joint Battle Command-Platform (JBC-P) is the next generation of the existing Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Joint Capabilities Release. Among the key areas of improvement required are a more intuitive graphical user interface, improved display of maps and images, and increased performance. <br>
<br>
Utilizing smartphone-like technology, dismounted soldiers are able to track friendly forces and vehicles, access Mission Command applications, and input and share battlefield information such as the location of threats. Features similar to those found in commercial devices, such as touch to zoom maps and drag and drop icons, are intuitive to learn and easy to use in the field.
