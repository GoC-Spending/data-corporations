What does a school look like that encourages learning?<br>
What kind of school inspires children as well as teaching staff?<br>
What kind of learning space spurs creativity, motivation and sense of well-being at the same time?<br>
These are the questions that our education suppliers ask when looking at furniture design. Our flagship sustainable manufacturers are dedicated to providing ergonomic and forward thinking furniture in the education sector and Total Interiors is proud to be the exclusive dealer in British Columbia.<br>
<br>
Our specialized education manufacturers are enhancing learning by creating innovative and ground breaking designs that change the way children interact with their environments. They encourage collaborative learning environments with their mobile and functional soft seating and focus on quality, reliability, safety, style, productivity and affordability.<br>
<br>
Based on research, and designed by kenetic scientists and ergonomic specialists children need to be in motion to learn. The promotion of movement increases body temperature elevating oxygen to the brain resulting in higher brain productivity. As a result, our products have received endorsement from both physiotherapists and occupational Therapists.<br>
<br>
At Total Education, we are the experts. Contact us to find out more about Learning commons, 21st Century Learning environments and Davinci Studios. We would be happy to provide you with information and a demo of these innovative educational products.<br>

<br>
Total Installations  because we finish the jobs we start.<br>
At Total Installations we take no chances of having someone else put the icing on our cakes.<br>
<br>
In order to best meet the needs of our clients, Total Installation completes the work we are asked to assist with starting. That means we are pleased to deliver and install the products that you have ordered from Total Interiors and our various specific companies such as Total Hospitality, Total Health, Total Education and, of course, Total Office.<br>
<br>
We have never understood why many companies drop the ball at the final and perhaps most important step in providing quality service to a client. It matters not if a client has ordered the finest in furniture or products if whoever delivers the order does not treat it with respect, or make sure it fits the customers expectations. As a customer we want you to be assured the products you order from us are installed correct, delivered prompt, safe, and sound, and that the design and planning we did together is competed professionally. We want you to be happy.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, we are proud of the fact that Total Installation is the newest addition to our company  and we are thrilled that we have top quality people working for us to ensure that nothing but quality work is applied in completing our commitment to you.<br>
<br>
At Total Installation we perform our own installations and also offer product relocation, reconfiguration, repairs, maintenance, service, and storage. In addition we also reupholster and clean furniture and products if desired.<br>
<br>
At Total Installation we proudly finish the job which we were originally contracted to begin.<br>
We leave nothing to chance, or rely on others.<br>
At Total Installation, that is our total commitment to you.<br>

What does a school look like that encourages learning?<br>
What kind of school inspires children as well as teaching staff?<br>
What kind of learning space spurs creativity, motivation and sense of well-being at the same time?<br>
These are the questions that our education suppliers ask when looking at furniture design. Our flagship sustainable manufacturers are dedicated to providing ergonomic and forward thinking furniture in the education sector and Total Interiors is proud to be the exclusive dealer in British Columbia.<br>
<br>
Our specialized education manufacturers are enhancing learning by creating innovative and ground breaking designs that change the way children interact with their environments. They encourage collaborative learning environments with their mobile and functional soft seating and focus on quality, reliability, safety, style, productivity and affordability.<br>
<br>
Based on research, and designed by kenetic scientists and ergonomic specialists children need to be in motion to learn. The promotion of movement increases body temperature elevating oxygen to the brain resulting in higher brain productivity. As a result, our products have received endorsement from both physiotherapists and occupational Therapists.<br>
<br>
At Total Education, we are the experts. Contact us to find out more about Learning commons, 21st Century Learning environments and Davinci Studios. We would be happy to provide you with information and a demo of these innovative educational products.<br>

<br>
Total Installations  because we finish the jobs we start.<br>
At Total Installations we take no chances of having someone else put the icing on our cakes.<br>
<br>
In order to best meet the needs of our clients, Total Installation completes the work we are asked to assist with starting. That means we are pleased to deliver and install the products that you have ordered from Total Interiors and our various specific companies such as Total Hospitality, Total Health, Total Education and, of course, Total Office.<br>
<br>
We have never understood why many companies drop the ball at the final and perhaps most important step in providing quality service to a client. It matters not if a client has ordered the finest in furniture or products if whoever delivers the order does not treat it with respect, or make sure it fits the customers expectations. As a customer we want you to be assured the products you order from us are installed correct, delivered prompt, safe, and sound, and that the design and planning we did together is competed professionally. We want you to be happy.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, we are proud of the fact that Total Installation is the newest addition to our company  and we are thrilled that we have top quality people working for us to ensure that nothing but quality work is applied in completing our commitment to you.<br>
<br>
At Total Installation we perform our own installations and also offer product relocation, reconfiguration, repairs, maintenance, service, and storage. In addition we also reupholster and clean furniture and products if desired.<br>
<br>
At Total Installation we proudly finish the job which we were originally contracted to begin.<br>
We leave nothing to chance, or rely on others.<br>
At Total Installation, that is our total commitment to you.<br>
