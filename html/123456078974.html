Yardstick provides full-solution examination and eLearning solutions, psychometric consulting services and instructional design to certification/licensure, government, corporate and academic clients.

In 2013, Christie Communications was the first company to win three prestigious Canadian Awards for Training Excellence by the Canadian Society for Training and Development (CSTD).

Integrated with Measure, Subject Matter Experts create the questions and store them in the secure item bank. These questions can then be built into exams and administered to candidates.<br>

The robust permission system allows each marker to only see the questions he/she has is permitted to grade. All candidate-identifying information is hidden to ensure ‘blind’ grading and is based solely on the scoring rubric criteria.<br>

                            Yardstick Itematic is a revolutionary way to build multiple questions at once without having to painstakingly write out each question individually. Based on the principles of automated item generation (AIG), Yardstick Itematic is a user-friendly web-based tool where your authors can create hundreds of questions at a time, instead of just one.<br>
<br>
Yardstick Itematic works by segmenting a question into multiple components based on its grammatical structure.<br>
<br>
Using a model defined by the user, a list of alternative stem components (e.g., procedures, symptoms, patient characteristics, etc.) become easily interchangeable. This allows users to quickly construct unique questions and answer options in a systematic manner that is more efficient than creating questions one by one.<br>
<br>
•	Easily create question templates<br>
•	Specify sets of valid question stems<br>
•	Create comprehensive lists of question options<br>
•	View various combinations and permutations<br>
•	Denote “friend” and “enemy” options<br>

                            Psychometrics is the field of science concerned with the theory and application of designing, planning, and implementing defensible assessments. <br>
Psychometricians generally have a graduate degree in a field like education or psychology specializing in statistical methods related to testing. Yardstick’s approach is not to shroud the complexities of this field in a veil of mystery; rather we demystify the processes involved in creating defensible assessments involving our clients every step of the way.<br>
This collaborative approach is just one of the reasons why Yardstick is a cut above the rest when it comes to psychometric services and building defensible examination programs.<br>

                            Yardstick eLearning offers a powerful delivery modality that has the power to transform your organization and training programs. Offering a wide variety of options and engaging material choices, Yardstick partners with your organization from start to finish and identifies what your learners need to know and the best way to engage your audience. We thrive on working with clients to solve new challenges for program design, technical deployment, and project logistics. <br>
<br>
Features:<br>
<br>
Our Instructional Design methodology is a pedagogical approach that begins with analysis and is centered around the creation and evaluation of learning objectives. These objectives are measurable statements of what the learner will be able to do after successfully completing the testing and training . While most courses include content at a knowledge level, higher-level objectives such as application, synthesis, and evaluation may also be addressed.<br>
<br>
Using SCORM, our eLearning programs will automatically handle module prerequisites, accurate tracking of learner data, and bookmarked progress throughout a course<br>
<br>
Gamification techniques engage learners and increase eLearning interactivity. This might include an immersive first-person perspective, making learners an integral part of the training outcome. Or perhaps a game board test, an interactive token tracker, or digital badges for sharing between work sites (or on social media). Gamification helps connect learning to on-the-job performance, making the experience credible and memorable.<br>
<br>
Responsive development framework, your courses can function on tablets, phones, and desktops. Learners with a broad range of devices and browsers will have access to a single source of content no matter how they access the eLearning. We can also create downloadable versions of eLearning programs to run off-line.<br>
<br>
3D immersive technology to run training simulations of hazardous situations, role-play human interactions, or teach the use of complex machinery in a zero risk environment.<br>
<br>
Custom media and voiceover narration are useful for providing examples, telling stories, and connecting the training to the learner’s environment. Whether still photos, video clips, graphics, or animations – the key is to provide a visual reference for learning and to personalize programs to the your organization. We can create programs for English speakers, English as a Second Language (ESL) learners, or in other languages such as French, Spanish, or Arabic.<br>

of training materials in print and computer based multimedia and <br>
Internet technologies.  We are interested in alliances of all <br>
forms with a special interest in finding agents in North America <br>
(where we can be of closer support) and exclusive <br>
distributorships in the rest of the world where an organization <br>
can take control.  We are also interested in investment, joint <br>
ventures and almost any other arrangement which can be of mutual <br>
benefit.

                            Yardstick Itematic is a revolutionary way to build multiple questions at once without having to painstakingly write out each question individually. Based on the principles of automated item generation (AIG), Yardstick Itematic is a user-friendly web-based tool where your authors can create hundreds of questions at a time, instead of just one.<br>
<br>
Yardstick Itematic works by segmenting a question into multiple components based on its grammatical structure.<br>
<br>
Using a model defined by the user, a list of alternative stem components (e.g., procedures, symptoms, patient characteristics, etc.) become easily interchangeable. This allows users to quickly construct unique questions and answer options in a systematic manner that is more efficient than creating questions one by one.<br>
<br>
•	Easily create question templates<br>
•	Specify sets of valid question stems<br>
•	Create comprehensive lists of question options<br>
•	View various combinations and permutations<br>
•	Denote “friend” and “enemy” options<br>

                            Psychometrics is the field of science concerned with the theory and application of designing, planning, and implementing defensible assessments. <br>
Psychometricians generally have a graduate degree in a field like education or psychology specializing in statistical methods related to testing. Yardstick’s approach is not to shroud the complexities of this field in a veil of mystery; rather we demystify the processes involved in creating defensible assessments involving our clients every step of the way.<br>
This collaborative approach is just one of the reasons why Yardstick is a cut above the rest when it comes to psychometric services and building defensible examination programs.<br>

                            Yardstick eLearning offers a powerful delivery modality that has the power to transform your organization and training programs. Offering a wide variety of options and engaging material choices, Yardstick partners with your organization from start to finish and identifies what your learners need to know and the best way to engage your audience. We thrive on working with clients to solve new challenges for program design, technical deployment, and project logistics. <br>
<br>
Features:<br>
<br>
Our Instructional Design methodology is a pedagogical approach that begins with analysis and is centered around the creation and evaluation of learning objectives. These objectives are measurable statements of what the learner will be able to do after successfully completing the testing and training . While most courses include content at a knowledge level, higher-level objectives such as application, synthesis, and evaluation may also be addressed.<br>
<br>
Using SCORM, our eLearning programs will automatically handle module prerequisites, accurate tracking of learner data, and bookmarked progress throughout a course<br>
<br>
Gamification techniques engage learners and increase eLearning interactivity. This might include an immersive first-person perspective, making learners an integral part of the training outcome. Or perhaps a game board test, an interactive token tracker, or digital badges for sharing between work sites (or on social media). Gamification helps connect learning to on-the-job performance, making the experience credible and memorable.<br>
<br>
Responsive development framework, your courses can function on tablets, phones, and desktops. Learners with a broad range of devices and browsers will have access to a single source of content no matter how they access the eLearning. We can also create downloadable versions of eLearning programs to run off-line.<br>
<br>
3D immersive technology to run training simulations of hazardous situations, role-play human interactions, or teach the use of complex machinery in a zero risk environment.<br>
<br>
Custom media and voiceover narration are useful for providing examples, telling stories, and connecting the training to the learner’s environment. Whether still photos, video clips, graphics, or animations – the key is to provide a visual reference for learning and to personalize programs to the your organization. We can create programs for English speakers, English as a Second Language (ESL) learners, or in other languages such as French, Spanish, or Arabic.<br>

                        Christie Communications is primarily interested in the creation<br>
of training materials in print and computer based multimedia and <br>
Internet technologies.  We are interested in alliances of all <br>
forms with a special interest in finding agents in North America <br>
(where we can be of closer support) and exclusive <br>
distributorships in the rest of the world where an organization <br>
can take control.  We are also interested in investment, joint <br>
ventures and almost any other arrangement which can be of mutual <br>
benefit.

We have helped firefighters extinguish forest fires and emergency physicians save lives.  We have helped showcase the past and encourage public understanding of our environment.
