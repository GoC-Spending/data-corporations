                            * TEFLON BASE LUBRICANT, SEALANT:<br>
<br>
For pipe threads and gaskets works as an anti seize lubricant and sealant, sealant, effective for use in up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit and pressure up to 20,000 PSI.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE has been developed as an all-purpose lubricant and sealant. TETRA-LUBE has been made for applications that require the best lubrication available. TETRA-LUBE processing and formulation enables it to provide a versatility not found in conventional lubricants.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is made with DuPont&#39;s &quot;TEFLON&quot; 1 which is inert and unaffected by acids, oils, caustics, aviation gasoline and common solvents. It is used in applications with temperatures up to 6000F, and displays one of the lowest coefficients of friction and anti-stick properties of any known material. As can be seen, TETRA-LUBE characteristics surpass the many conventional lubricants in overall performance.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is packaged in a concentrated form for immediate use with demanding and difficult lubrication requirements. <br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE gives that long lasting protection to the coated parts which keeps equipment in top operating condition. Equipment that <br>
has been in operation for some time will begin to perform as it did when first put into operation. Machining equipment such as lathes, illustrates one application where the application of <br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE provides superior service. Equipment such as this demands the best lubricant available, since precision work requires smooth operational control.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is recommended for the lubrication requirements of equipment that must be operated over extended periods of time and where shutdowns are prohibitive. TETRA-LUBE provides the superior lubrication and continuous service that is needed. Equipment will operate with the highest degree of efficiency and equipment wear will be reduced to a minimum. The loss of lubricant will be arrested through the unique sealing characteristics of TETRA-LUBE.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is mixed with conventional oils and greases by users who wish to increase the lubricity and protection to coated parts. As little as one ounce of TETRA-LUBE may be added to a quart of any conventional lubricant to enjoy this additional protection and lubricity. Applications such as gear and chain drive units gearboxes, draw works, engine drive groups and direct rotary drives are excellent examples of TETRA-Lubes use in this manner. Not only is superior lubrication obtained, but also heat generation is reduced and maintenance is kept at a minimum.<br>
<br>
In addition to superior lubrication and protection of coated parts, TETRA-LUBE provides and additional service as a sealant. This is just one more example of TETRA-LUBE superiority in comparison with other lubricants on the market. Not only is the best lubrication where you need it, but it absolutely reduces leakage. Application of TETRA-LUBE to valves and to threaded connections eliminates leakage and allows parts to be broken out without galling and seizing.<br>
<br>
Metal surfaces consist of a series of high and low points of contact. Friction generates from the contact of these conflicting points and the force required to push one surface through another. TETRA-LUBE overcomes and decreases this phenomenon by filling the low areas, making the metal surfaces a surface of TETRA-LUBE. The prevention of metal-to-metal contact provides superior lubrication and TETRA-LUBE provides this prevention in the most efficient and economical manner possible.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is available in six grades, filling the complete range of applications.<br>
<br>
L1 FORMULA 350: In liquid form, for lighter applications, including small pipe threads.Not recommended for packing.<br>
<br>

(POWDER OR LIQUID)<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C. is used in conjunction with D.M. CONCENTRATE where the water is high in temporary or carbonate hardness. C.T.N.C. <br>
functions are the same as C.T.B. to raise the pH of the boiler water, however, it is more efficient with water of temporary <br>
hardness than C.T.B.<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C. contains caustic and should be treated with care. However, it has inhibitors against caustic embrittlement which <br>
are more than adequate. D.M. CONCENTRATE itself is also an inhibitor against caustic embrittlement. C.T.N.C. will absorb <br>
some carbon dioxide in the water but it is not complete protection for return lines against carbon dioxide corrosion. <br>
Nothing will give complete return line corrosion protection except one of our product Neutratherm neutralizing amine,or <br>
Thermafilm filming amine. However, C.T.N.C. materially aids in this protection.<br>
<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.N.C. POWDER is 500-mg powder for each 1000 litters of raw make-up. <br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.N.C. LIQUID is approximately 20 oz. (590 ml) per 250 gallons of raw feed. Maintain boiler water pH between 9 and 10 , check with Litmus (pH) paper. <br>

<br>
C.T.B. is a special mineral alkaline, blended for use with D.M. CONCENTRATE. It is used with distilled, demineralized or water high in permanent hardness. It is also recommended for use in dairies or other manufacturers of food products.<br>
<br>
None of the conjunctional treatments nor D.M. CONCENTRATE will carry over with the steam itself, however, if priming or foaming <br>
occurs in the boiler, water in the form of bubbles is carried over. The D.M. or C.T.B. in that bubble water will naturally go <br>
over too. Neither D.M. CONCENTRATE nor C.T.B. is toxic.<br>
<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.B. POWDER is 2.2 Lb. (1 Kg) of C.T.B. powder for every 1000 litters of raw make-up.<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.B. LIQUID is approximately 40 oz (1136 ml) per 250 gallons of raw make-up. Maintain bubble water pH between 9 and 10, check with Litmus (pH) paper.<br>

                            STEAM BOILERS AND GENERATORS WATER TREATMENT<br>
<br>
1- Corrosion Control and Scale Inhibitor<br>
<br>
Based on a blend of carefully selected tannins for use in steam raising boilers and generators. provides both corrosion protection, scale inhibition, oxygen scavenging , forming a protective film and disrupting the crystal growth. <br>
<br>
D.M.Concentrate also prevents galvanic or electrolytic corrosion up to 2 volts and conditions the sludge.<br>
<br>
D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT FOR STEAM SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate is composed of several different organic tannins, both natural and synthetic. The formulation was carefully compounded to give the highest efficiency with all types of water in high, low and medium pressure boilers. It is also the ideal treatment for any residual hardness or residual oxygen, which may carry over from pre-treatment. The various components of D.M. Concentrate have been selected for their exceptional stability under all boiler conditions.<br>
<br>
All the various organic components act in oxygen absorption, in forming a light flocculent sludge instead of scale, and in changing the oxide surface of all underwater ferrous substances to tannen/ferric complex. Some are better than others as oxygen scavengers. Some are better than others in forming sludge. Some in keeping it finely divided and flocculent. However, all work together as a team to produce the finest results. In many cases, one or two act as catalysts on each other. Blended together giving better results than the same amount of one ingredient alone.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate immediately acts on all dissolved and free oxygen in water, and in a matter of seconds all oxygen is absorbed.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate does not act on dissolved solids. While they are in solution, they are harmless. However, as they come out of solution in the crystalline form and are in a position to form scale, the D.M. Concentrate as a colloidal suspension immediately coats the crystals as they start to form with a Monomolecular, non-adherent, colloidal &quot;sheen&quot; preventing crystalline growth and crystalline adherence by distorting the crystal shape, so that they cannot form scale, but only finely divided sludge which is removed with normal blow-down.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate also chemically reacts with the underwater oxide surface of the various boiler tubes, boiler walls, and the tube sheets forming an inert tannate/ferric &quot;sheen&quot;. This &quot;sheen&quot; gives absolutely no thermal insulation. However, by <br>
covering the anode of the iron and changing the oxide cathodes to an inert tannate, existing galvanic corrosion is sealed off and future galvanic corrosion prevented, both by anodic and cathodic protection up to 2 Volts D.C.<br>
<br>
The carefully calculated formulation of D.M. Concentrate and the interaction of its components render its action more effective than the action produced by any single tannin. Although D.M. Concentrate may appear to cost more per quart or gallon than other boiler treatments on the market, it must be remembered that D.M. is a CONCENTRATE. By manufacturing D.M. Concentrate ourselves, under our own control and supervision. The true test of the economy of a treatment is not the price per quart but how many thousand gallons of steam producing water that quart will treat. Also, how effectively it maintains the boiler in proper condition and eliminates continuous and costly down time and maintenance. The average dosage is up to 5 oz. per 1,000 gallons of make-up water.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br>
<br>
1. D.M. Concentrate prevents hardness and other scale forming substances in solution or suspended matter entering the boiler with the feed water from adhering to the heated surfaces and a scale free boiler is maintained.<br>
<br>
2. Silica, by the action of D.M. Concentrate is prevented from complexing with iron, alumina and hardness salts to form silicate scales.<br>
<br>
3. Oxygen is absorbed in the boiler and pre-boiler parts of the system.<br>
<br>
4. Active corrosion is arrested and incidence of further corrosion is prevented by the formation of the tannate/ferric oxide on underwater surfaces.<br>
<br>
5. D.M. Concentrate reacts with any free iron in suspension to produce a tannate-iron oxide complex which counteracts its tendency to adhere to heated surfaces, particularly so when the surface has been changed by D.M. Concentrate to the tannate/ferric surface. This iron or iron oxide in suspension may have come from pick-up in the feed system or other systems external to the boiler.<br>
<br>
6. The addition of D.M. Concentrate forming a colloidal suspension does not appreciably increase the total dissolved solids of the boiler water necessitating a greatly increased blow down. Over dosing of D.M. Concentrate can do no harm as the D.M. Concentrate in the boiler water is a reserve for future need, and this is merely increasing the reserve.  <br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate will not carry over with steam.<br>
<br>
Conventional chemical treatments usually based on phosphate and soda themselves contribute substantially to the total dissolved solids of the boiler water materially increasing the necessary blow down. They often change the boiler&#39;s action into not only being a boiler, but having to be a softening plant as well. The amount of alkalinity necessary to do the softening job, sometimes increases the T.D.S. and the alkalinity to the point where foaming and priming are likely -especially when sudden changes in the boiler load take place. With D.M., alkaline chemicals are only used to raise the pH to between 9.5 to 10 (this is below the T.D.S. and alkalinity limits, where priming or foaming is likely). They eliminate any possibility of acid corrosion and the D.M. Concentrate goes further and has greater oxygen absorption ability in alkaline waters. By using our conjunctional treatments with D.M., the amount of D.M. Concentrate used is slightly lowered.<br>
<br>
7. D.M. Concentrate itself tends to inhibit caustic embrittlement. In any conjunctional treatment we supply for use with D.M. Concentrate in which there is caustic there is enough nitrate mixed with the caustic to insure that the caustic-nitrate ratio is above that needed to prevent caustic embrittlement.<br>
<br>
8. D.M. Concentrate is non-toxic, non-caustic and is absolutely safe to handle and store.  D.M. Concentrate is COMPLETELY <br>
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.<br>
<br>
9. Administration of the treatment is safe and simple. The testing procedure is positive and simple and is more easily and more quickly carried out by boiler room personnel.<br>
<br>
10. The action of D.M. Concentrate in scale prevention is physical or mechanical - not chemical, with the result that D.M. Concentrate may be used to prevent scale formation in any type of water.<br>
<br>
As the action of D.M. Concentrate on suspended Matter or dissolved solids as they come out of solution is mechanical, the D.M. Concentrate does not differentiate between silica and calcium sulphate for instance. It is equally efficient in protection against every kind of scale, from all types of water.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate has little effect on pH value. It is non-alkaline and about as acid as a &quot;good cup of tea&quot;.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be used in boiler pressures where the temperature and pressure are high enough to render sodium sulphite unsafe, as sodium sulphite will, at these temperatures and pressures, possibly form sulphuric or sulphurous acid.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be, and should be, used after softening plants or any type of pre-treatment. The amount of D.M. Concentrate used will naturally be greatly lowered. The D.M. Concentrate reserve in the water is there when needed to treat any residual hardness or any residual oxygen that may come over due to any maloperation of the pre-treated plant or sudden increased demands above its designed flow rate.<br>
<br>
2- pH Control For Steam Boilers<br>
<br>
Specially formulated to control and rise the pH in the boiler water.<br>
<br>
CONJUNCTIONAL TREATMENT (POWDER OR LIQUID)<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C. is used in conjunction with D.M. CONCENTRATE where the water is high in temporary or carbonate hardness. C.T.N.C. functions are the same as C.T.B. to raise the pH of the boiler water, however, it is more efficient with water of temporary <br>
hardness than C.T.B.<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C. contains caustic and should be treated with care. However, it has inhibitors against caustic embrittlement which are more than adequate. D.M. CONCENTRATE itself is also an inhibitor against caustic embrittlement. C.T.N.C. will absorb some carbon dioxide in the water but it is not complete protection for return lines against carbon dioxide corrosion. Nothing will give complete return line corrosion protection except one of our product Neutratherm neutralizing amine,or Thermafilm filming amine. However, C.T.N.C. materially aids in this protection.<br>
<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.N.C. POWDER is 500-mg powder for each 1000 litters of raw make-up. <br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.N.C. LIQUID is approximately 20 oz. (590 ml) per 250 gallons of raw feed. Maintain boiler water pH between 9 and 10 , check with Litmus (pH) paper. <br>
<br>
C.T.B<br>
<br>
C.T.B. is a special mineral alkaline, blended for use with D.M. CONCENTRATE. It is used with distilled, demineralized or water high in permanent hardness. It is also recommended for use in dairies or other manufacturers of food products.<br>
<br>
None of the conjunctional treatments nor D.M. CONCENTRATE will carry over with the steam itself, however, if priming or foaming <br>
occurs in the boiler, water in the form of bubbles is carried over. The D.M. or C.T.B. in that bubble water will naturally go over too. Neither D.M. CONCENTRATE nor C.T.B. is toxic.<br>
<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.B. POWDER is 2.2 Lb. (1 Kg) of C.T.B. powder for every 1000 litters of raw make-up.<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.B. LIQUID is approximately 40 oz (1136 ml) per 250 gallons of raw make-up. Maintain bubble water pH between 9 and 10, check with Litmus (pH). paper.<br>

3- Condensate Return Line Treatment<br>
<br>
Whether it neutralizing amines, filming amines or a combination of both, you can be assured that the program we recommend will <br>
be the best one for your system.<br>
<br>
NEUTRATHERM<br>
<br>
Description And Use<br>
<br>
Neutratherm is a liquid neutralizing amine, approximately 99% active material, and is used to prevent corrosion in the steam condensate  systems.<br>
<br>
Treatment And Dosage<br>
<br>
The optimum treatment level for Neutratherm depends on factors such as: the condensate pH and operating conditions. The product should be used in accordance with the control procedures established by Thermidaire Corporation for specific systems.<br>
<br>
The dosage of Neutratherm depends on the amount of free and  Bicarbonate CO2 in feed water, Usually is 2.5 Lb. of Neutratherm <br>
per million Lb. of steam generated.<br>
<br>
Neutratherm is volatile and it should be injected to the boiler as close as possible. It can be fed to the boiler or directly to the steam header.<br>
<br>
benefits<br>
<br>
Prevents corrosion due to dissolved CO2<br>
Prevents Corrosion due to dissolved O2<br>
On-site tests allow a correct monitoring<br>
May aid thermal efficiency.<br>
<br>
Neutratherm is based on a blend of amines <br>
<br>
THERMAFILM<br>
<br>
Description And Use<br>
<br>
Thermafilm is a complex organic material, filming amine, used to prevent corrosion in steam condensate systems by forming a film <br>
on the metal surfaces. The film also promotes a drop wise condensation and therefore improves the thermal efficiency.<br>
<br>
Treatment And Dosage<br>
<br>
The optimum treatment levels for Thermafilm depend on factors such as the condensate pH and operating conditions.<br>
<br>
Thermafilm can be fed into the boiler through the feed water line, the boiler drum the condensate return tank or through the steam header. Continuous feed into the steam line is desired but shot feeding is acceptable where the make-up requirements are less than 20%.<br>
<br>
The injection into the teed water or boiler water is acceptable in certain circumstances.<br>
<br>
The product should be used in accordance with the control procedures established by Thermidaire Corporation for the specific systems.<br>
<br>
Thermafilm should be diluted with 60-1150F condensate water (preferably raw water), softened water. Feed water or boiler water should not be used for this purpose.<br>
<br>
Thermafilm should not be mixed with other treating chemicals in the same feed tank or with water which has a pH level above 9.0<br>
<br>
Benefits<br>
<br>
Prevents corrosion due to dissolved CO2.<br>
Prevents corrosion due to dissolved O2.<br>
On-site control tests allow a correct monitoring.<br>
May aid thermal efficiency.<br>
Thermafilm is based on long chain fatty primary amines<br>
<br>
APPLICATION OF NEUTRATHERM AND THERMAFILM<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s have a close look at the properties, application and limitations of our two steam and return line corrosion control products.<br>
<br>
NEUTRATHERM<br>
<br>
This product is a 99% active dispersion of a complex alkaline amine. When fed to the boiler it volatizes over with the steam and condenses in the condensate, raising the pH above 7.0, thereby neutralizing the carbonic acid formed when carbon dioxide condenses with steam. This product protects against CARBON DIOXIDE CORROSION ONLY. If oxygen is present in the steam and condensate, pitting type corrosion can still occur, although the severity of oxygen attack is minimized at pH&#39;s above 7.0 <br>
<br>
Because Neutratherm is volatile and vaporizes at elevated temperatures, it should be fed through a chemical pot feeder as close to the boiler as possible. Avoid feeding to hot condensate tanks, or a good portion of the Neutratherm will be lost to atmosphere before reaching the boiler.<br>
<br>
THERMAFILM<br>
<br>
This product protects steam and condensate lines against BOTH carbon dioxide and oxygen corrosion. Thermafilm is a filming type amine.<br>
<br>
Although this product is alkaline, it affords protection to the steam and return condensate system, not by raising pH but by forming impervious non-wettable film on the interior metal pipe walls. This creates a film-type barrier against the corrosive action of oxygen and carbon dioxide.<br>
<br>
Thermafilm must be fed continuously and separately from other chemicals. It must be mixed in warm condensate, never above pH <br>
9.0. Over-dosing must be avoided since this will cause the Octadecylamine to separate in the steam and &quot;Gunk&quot; out in the system as a sticky, gummy precipitate. Please refer all Thermafilm proposals to Head Office for review.<br>
<br>
Both Thermafilm and Neutratherm have a highly detergent action in removing existing iron oxide deposits in lines and traps. <br>
<br>
Initial dosages should be kept to a minimum when treating older systems.<br>

                            *S.H.W HOT AND CHILLED WATERS SYSTEMS (CLOSED LOOP) WATER TREATMENT <br>
<br>
To inhibit corrosion, disperse solids and selectively protect integral components of your closed water &amp; chilled water systems <br>
we offer numerous easy to monitor programs designed with operator convenience in mind.<br>
<br>
S.H.W CONCENTRATE  <br>
<br>
S.H.W.  is a complex colourless water treatment for hot and chilled water systems, to control and protect  corrosion in hot <br>
and cold water systems. and will last for more than 3 years in closed systems.<br>
<br>
A thin tenacious film is formed on the metal surface. This film does not build up on itself to form a scale, and therefore does <br>
not obstruct the flow of water, nor is the transfer of heat affected in anyway.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  does not depend on alkalinity or the pH value of the water, but is dependent on the silica content of the silicate. Protection is obtainable in waters that are both acid and slightly alkaline up to a pH of 8.5.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  is effective with,<br>
<br>
Iron; Steel; Galvanized Iron; Red Brass; Yellow Brass; Copper; Bronze; Nickel alloys and Zinc. It is also effective with one or more of these metals used in conjunction with another, which normally would cause galvanic action.<br>
<br>
Directions<br>
<br>
Add:  1 gallon for each 1000 gallons of water in the system. OR 1 pint for every 1000 sq. foot of heating  surface (for schools and apartment buildings). Control may be checked by a silica (Si) reading keeping it between  35 PPM to 40 PPM.  Should water turn reddish, empty system.  Flash and refill with same initial dosage.  Some  areas require this to be done 2 or 3 times.  The reddish colour is from the removal of iron oxides. <br>
<br>
S.H.W. film starts forming immediately at the point of application, gradually extending through the complete  system. For long rambling systems it could take up to 30 days to have a film on the entire system.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  may be fed through pot feeders or proportioning pumps. The latter should be diluted at a ratio of 1:1.<br>
<br>
Advantages of S.H.W<br>
<br>
  1. It is inexpensive and simple to use.<br>
  2. Frequent water analyses are not necessary. At the  commencement once a week, after three months, once a month should be sufficient.<br>
  3. Film cannot build up to form a scale, or impede the water flow.<br>
  4. Film does not affect heat transfer.<br>
  5. Water hardness is not increased.<br>
  6. S.H.W. is effective in the pH range of 8 to 8.5 (normal)<br>
  7. As a result, pH need not be raised to higher levels to assure efficiency.<br>
  8. It is harmless, and non-toxic.<br>
  9. Will last up to 3 years in closed system.<br>

<br>
H.D. POWDER &amp; LIQUID<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION AND USE<br>
<br>
H.D. is a non-caustic, powder degreasing soluble in hot water, incorporating a blend of alkalis with suitable wettants.<br>
<br>
H.D. is non-corrosive to ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Extra care should be given when cleaning aluminum and its alloys.<br>
<br>
H.D. removes greasy and oil bound deposits from all surfaces and it is applied to condensers, oil coolers, engine and compressor water jackets, air coolers, engine parts lubricating the oil systems, pavement and concrete, and it is widely used for degreasing the new boilers and removing the oil contamination from the boiler feed water lines as well as the chilled water systems.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT AND DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
H.D. powder should be dissolved in hot water at a temperature of approximately 1500F. H.D. is used at a ratio of 15 Lb. for each 200 gallons of water in the boiler and/or system.<br>
<br>
For other use, the solution concentration depends on the nature of the deposits and on the type of the plant (range 1-10%).<br>
<br>
When cleaning aluminum or its alloys H.D. should be used at ambient temperature and not more than 5% strength.<br>
<br>
H.D. in a liquid form can be poured directly into the boiler through the manhole or valve cover opening, or circulated by an <br>
independent pump. The tank surfaces should be frequently scammed.<br>
<br>
H.D. treatment should be followed by a hot water flushing procedure.<br>
<br>

<br>
THERMIZE<br>
<br>
Description And Use<br>
<br>
Thermize is a cationic based compound used for mud and oxides removal. It is high molecular weight, polymeric material functioning as a polyelectrolyte causing an agglomeration of the particles and in effect more flocculent, looser mud easy to remove by blowdown. Thermize is widely used for heating and cooling systems.<br>
<br>
THERMIZE is normally used along with boiler water treatment program or for thorough cleaning of the system during the shutdown period.<br>
<br>
Treatment And Dosage<br>
<br>
The correct application of Thermize will be given by Thermidaire Corporation and it is dependent of many factors, such as: the type and the characteristics of the operating system , and the purpose Thermize will be used for.<br>
<br>
For cooling systems the dosage will be 1 quart of Thermize per 100-ton capacity per week. For cleaning purposes Thermize should be used at a rate of 1 gallon per 1,000 gallons of water.<br>

DESCRIPTION AND USE<br>
<br>
S.F.C. is a sludge and foam product being a hydrophillic colloid, non-toxic substance that completely dissolves in water. <br>
<br>
S.F.C. reacts readily with metallic ions such as calcium and iron to form a large floc or colloidal precipitate of the metal. It will not attack nor dissolve the iron from the boiler shell, walls or tubes.<br>
<br>
S.F.C. is used for the carry-over prevention in boilers or evaporators and to remove the heavy sludge.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT AND DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
The amount of S.F.C. required will vary with different operating conditions from 1/2 to 3/4 oz. of diluted solution (4:1 per gallon of make-up water). S.F.C. should be diluted in a ratio (1 quart of S.F.C. to 3 quarts of tap water) and injected continuously to the suction of the boiler feed pump, or directly to the boiler for each gallon of feed water required.<br>
<br>
The optimum treatment level for any plant will be specified by Thermidaire Corporation and will be dependent upon the water <br>
parameters.<br>
<br>

<br>
Ingredients Procurement <br>
<br>
We depend on imports for a large portion of the raw materials we use in our products. We purchase from Canada and the United <br>
States, Each ingredient and production location is carefully selected, reflecting our stance that top-quality products can only be made using top-quality ingredients.<br>
<br>
Production <br>
<br>
The Company&#39;s fundamental policy is to set up production facilities close to where its products are consumed. Reflecting this policy, with this in mind, we are seeking the creation of new Joint ventures around the world. As part of our strategy to reduce procurement and production costs, we are planing to set up operations in Middle East, Europe, and the Far East. In the future, we intend to continue expanding our operations in China, Taiwan, Malaysia and other Asian nations in partnership with local companies.<br>
<br>
Diverse Research &amp; Development <br>
Initiatives To fortify our product development and basic research capabilities, we upgraded and expanded the functions of Thermidaire Research Laboratory, We added a swimming pool product development Centre and fine chemicals department to the existing technology research Centre. In these ways, we are working to quickly and accurately pinpoint market needs and develop new products, we have built an organisation that allows us to swiftly develop new products and improve existing ones. We now have a structure that facilitates our efforts to refine basic technologies and produce original R&amp;D achievements in the medium and long terms.<br>
<br>
Meeting International Standards <br>
<br>
Paralleling to the plans for global expansion of Thermidaire business is a need to meet international product quality and environmental standards. Since we manufacture and sell our products internationally, it is essential that we develop, manufacture and distribute products that fully meet global standards for quality, so our customers&#39; world-wide can use our products with peace of mind. To enhance awareness among customers of our product quality, we are raising our standards as part of a Company wide effort to secure certification under ISO 9002, an international standard for product quality. We are implementing new standards throughout our facilities. This has had a positive effect on our efforts to standardise other internal procedures, we earned official certification from <br>
Agriculture Canada for the use of our products in food establishment. New laws was enacted in most countries of the world as part of the nation&#39;s environmental protection initiative, We intend to develop our business while strictly adhering to domestic and international standards for product quality and environmental protection. To assure our ability to supply customers with quality, reliable, price-competitive products, we are reorganizing our production, distribution and marketing systems in North America and overseas.<br>
<br>
Production and Distribution <br>
<br>
Our production and distribution facility in Scarborough has been the Centre of the Company&#39;s operations for over 30 years. Due to <br>
the ageing of this facility, we have moved to temporary to our Mississauga sales location, we are working on constructing a new plant and distribution Centre in London, Ontario, which will become our operation Centre. We have set up distribution centres in Toronto, Scarborough, Mississauga, London, Barry, Niagara, Leamington (Ontario), Halifax (Nova Scotia), Edmonton, Calgary (Alberta), Vancouver (British Colombia), Sea Grit (New Jersey, USA), Tucson (Arizona USA), Buffalo New York  (USA). <br>
<br>
Marketing <br>
<br>
Due to growth of economy, industry, new building construction etc.  In North America in recent years, market demand for industrial water treatment chemicals have increased Responding to this situation, we restructured and strengthened our national and internal operations to enhance our marketing capabilities to meet expanding commercial, residential and industrial demands. <br>
<br>
This has allowed us to develop more carefully targeted products and respond more accurately to the demands of our distributors <br>
and customers, we conduct ongoing market research to determine market needs. We then analyse the collected data and use it to <br>
speed up product development and marketing activities. <br>
<br>
As part of our sales promotion efforts, we also hold water treatment classes. <br>
<br>
Our prices are set to be at least 30% lower than our competition.<br>

                            * HOT AND CHILLED WATERS SYSTEMS (CLOSED LOOP) WATER TREATMENT <br>
<br>
To inhibit corrosion, disperse solids and selectively protect integral components of your closed water &amp; chilled water systems <br>
we offer numerous easy to monitor programs designed with operator convenience in mind.<br>
<br>
S.H.W CONCENTRATE  <br>
<br>
S.H.W.  is a complex colourless water treatment for hot and chilled water systems, to control and protect  corrosion in hot <br>
and cold water systems. and will last for more than 3 years in closed systems.<br>
<br>
A thin tenacious film is formed on the metal surface. This film does not build up on itself to form a scale, and therefore does <br>
not obstruct the flow of water, nor is the transfer of heat affected in anyway.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  does not depend on alkalinity or the pH value of the water, but is dependent on the silica content of the silicate. Protection is obtainable in waters that are both acid and slightly alkaline up to a pH of 8.5.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  is effective with,<br>
<br>
Iron; Steel; Galvanized Iron; Red Brass; Yellow Brass; Copper; Bronze; Nickel alloys and Zinc. It is also effective with one or more of these metals used in conjunction with another, which normally would cause galvanic action.<br>
<br>
Directions<br>
<br>
Add:  1 gallon for each 1000 gallons of water in the system. OR 1 pint for every 1000 sq. foot of heating  surface (for schools and apartment buildings). Control may be checked by a silica (Si) reading keeping it between  35 PPM to 40 PPM.  Should water turn reddish, empty system.  Flash and refill with same initial dosage.  Some  areas require this to be done 2 or 3 times.  The reddish colour is from the removal of iron oxides. <br>
<br>
S.H.W. film starts forming immediately at the point of application, gradually extending through the complete  system. For long rambling systems it could take up to 30 days to have a film on the entire system.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  may be fed through pot feeders or proportioning pumps. The latter should be diluted at a ratio of 1:1.<br>
<br>
Advantages of S.H.W<br>
<br>
  1. It is inexpensive and simple to use.<br>
  2. Frequent water analyses are not necessary. At the  commencement once a week, after three months, once a month should be sufficient.<br>
  3. Film cannot build up to form a scale, or impede the water flow.<br>
  4. Film does not affect heat transfer.<br>
  5. Water hardness is not increased.<br>
  6. S.H.W. is effective in the pH range of 8 to 8.5 (normal)<br>
  7. As a result, pH need not be raised to higher levels to assure efficiency.<br>
  8. It is harmless, and non-toxic.<br>
  9. Will last up to 3 years in closed system.<br>

                            STEAM BOILERS AND GENERATORS WATER TREATMENT<br>
<br>
Corrosion Control <br>
<br>
Based on a blend of carefully selected tannins for use in steam raising boilers and generators. provides both corrosion protection, scale inhibition, oxygen scavenging , forming a protective film and disrupting the crystal growth. <br>
<br>
D.M.Concentrate also prevents galvanic or electrolytic corrosion up to 2 volts and conditions the sludge.<br>
<br>
D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT FOR STEAM SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate is composed of several different organic tannins, both natural and synthetic. The formulation was carefully compounded to give the highest efficiency with all types of water in high, low and medium pressure boilers. It is also the ideal treatment for any residual hardness or residual oxygen, which may carry over from pre-treatment. The various components of D.M. Concentrate have been selected for their exceptional stability under all boiler conditions.<br>
<br>
All the various organic components act in oxygen absorption, in forming a light flocculent sludge instead of scale, and in changing the oxide surface of all underwater ferrous substances to tannen/ferric complex. Some are better than others as oxygen scavengers. Some are better than others in forming sludge. Some in keeping it finely divided and flocculent. However, all work together as a team to produce the finest results. In many cases, one or two act as catalysts on each other. Blended together giving better results than the same amount of one ingredient alone.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate immediately acts on all dissolved and free oxygen in water, and in a matter of seconds all oxygen is absorbed.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate does not act on dissolved solids. While they are in solution, they are harmless. However, as they come out of solution in the crystalline form and are in a position to form scale, the D.M. Concentrate as a colloidal suspension immediately coats the crystals as they start to form with a Monomolecular, non-adherent, colloidal &quot;sheen&quot; preventing crystalline growth and crystalline adherence by distorting the crystal shape, so that they cannot form scale, but only finely divided sludge which is removed with normal blow-down.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate also chemically reacts with the underwater oxide surface of the various boiler tubes, boiler walls, and the tube sheets forming an inert tannate/ferric &quot;sheen&quot;. This &quot;sheen&quot; gives absolutely no thermal insulation. However, by covering the anode of the iron and changing the oxide cathodes to an inert tannate, existing galvanic corrosion is sealed off and future galvanic corrosion prevented, both by anodic and cathodic protection up to 2 Volts D.C.<br>
<br>
The carefully calculated formulation of D.M. Concentrate and the interaction of its components render its action more effective than the action produced by any single tannin.<br>
<br>
Although D.M. Concentrate may appear to cost more per quart or gallon than other boiler treatments on the market, it must be remembered that D.M. is a CONCENTRATE. By manufacturing D.M. Concentrate ourselves, under our own control and supervision. <br>
<br>
The true test of the economy of a treatment is not the price per quart but how many thousand gallons of steam producing water that quart will treat. Also, how effectively it maintains the boiler in proper condition and eliminates continuous and costly down time and maintenance. The average dosage is up to 5 oz. per 1,000 gallons of make-up water.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br>
<br>
1. D.M. Concentrate prevents hardness and other scale forming substances in solution or suspended matter entering the boiler with the feed water from adhering to the heated surfaces and a scale free boiler is maintained.<br>
<br>
2. Silica, by the action of D.M. Concentrate is prevented from complexing with iron, alumina and hardness salts to form silicate scales.<br>
<br>
3. Oxygen is absorbed in the boiler and pre-boiler parts of the system.<br>
<br>
4. Active corrosion is arrested and incidence of further corrosion is prevented by the formation of the tannate/ferric oxide on underwater surfaces.<br>
<br>
5. D.M. Concentrate reacts with any free iron in suspension to produce a tannate-iron oxide complex which counteracts its tendency to adhere to heated surfaces, particularly so when the surface has been changed by D.M. Concentrate to the tannate/ferric surface. This iron or iron oxide in suspension may have come from pick-up in the feed system or other systems external to the boiler.<br>
<br>
6. The addition of D.M. Concentrate forming a colloidal suspension does not appreciably increase the total dissolved solids of the boiler water necessitating a greatly increased blow down. Over dosing of D.M. Concentrate can do no harm as the D.M. Concentrate in the boiler water is a reserve for future need, and this is merely increasing the reserve.  <br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate will not carry over with steam.<br>
<br>
Conventional chemical treatments usually based on phosphate and soda themselves contribute substantially to the total dissolved <br>
solids of the boiler water materially increasing the necessary blow down. They often change the boiler&#39;s action into not only being a boiler, but having to be a softening plant as well. The amount of alkalinity necessary to do the softening job, sometimes increases the T.D.S. and the alkalinity to the point where foaming and priming are likely -especially when sudden changes in the boiler load take place. With D.M., alkaline chemicals are only used to raise the pH to between 9.5 to 10 (this is below the T.D.S. and alkalinity limits, where priming or foaming is likely). They eliminate any possibility of acid corrosion and the D.M. Concentrate goes further and has greater oxygen absorption ability in alkaline waters. By using our conjunctional treatments with D.M., the amount of D.M. Concentrate used is slightly lowered.<br>
<br>
7. D.M. Concentrate itself tends to inhibit caustic embrittlement. In any conjunctional treatment we supply for use with D.M. Concentrate in which there is caustic there is enough nitrate mixed with the caustic to insure that the caustic-nitrate ratio is above that needed to prevent caustic embrittlement.<br>
<br>
8. D.M. Concentrate is non-toxic, non-caustic and is absolutely safe to handle and store.  D.M. Concentrate is COMPLETELY <br>
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.<br>
<br>
9. Administration of the treatment is safe and simple. The testing procedure is positive and simple and is more easily and more quickly carried out by boiler room personnel.<br>
<br>
10. The action of D.M. Concentrate in scale prevention is physical or mechanical - not chemical, with the result that D.M. Concentrate may be used to prevent scale formation in any type of water.<br>
<br>
As the action of D.M. Concentrate on suspended Matter or dissolved solids as they come out of solution is mechanical, the D.M. Concentrate does not differentiate between silica and calcium sulphate for instance. It is equally efficient in protection against every kind of scale, from all types of water.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate has little effect on pH value. It is non-alkaline and about as acid as a &quot;good cup of tea&quot;.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be used in boiler pressures where the temperature and pressure are high enough to render sodium sulphite unsafe, as sodium sulphite will, at these temperatures and pressures, possibly form sulphuric or sulphurous acid.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be, and should be, used after softening plants or any type of pre-treatment. The amount of D.M. Concentrate used will naturally be greatly lowered. The D.M. Concentrate reserve in the water is there when needed to treat any residual hardness or any residual oxygen that may come over due to any maloperation of the pre-treated plant or sudden increased demands above its designed flow rate.<br>

                            STEAM BOILERS AND GENERATORS WATER TREATMENT<br>
<br>
Scale Inhibitor<br>
<br>
Based on a blend of carefully selected tannins for use in steam raising boilers and generators. provides both corrosion protection, scale inhibition, oxygen scavenging , forming a protective film and disrupting the crystal growth. <br>
<br>
D.M.Concentrate also prevents galvanic or electrolytic corrosion up to 2 volts and conditions the sludge.<br>
<br>
D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT FOR STEAM SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate is composed of several different organic tannins, both natural and synthetic. The formulation was carefully compounded to give the highest efficiency with all types of water in high, low and medium pressure boilers. It is also the ideal treatment for any residual hardness or residual oxygen, which may carry over from pre-treatment. The various components of D.M. Concentrate have been selected for their exceptional stability under all boiler conditions.<br>
<br>
All the various organic components act in oxygen absorption, in forming a light flocculent sludge instead of scale, and in changing the oxide surface of all underwater ferrous substances to tannen/ferric complex. Some are better than others as oxygen scavengers. Some are better than others in forming sludge. Some in keeping it finely divided and flocculent. However, all work together as a team to produce the finest results. In many cases, one or two act as catalysts on each other. Blended together giving better results than the same amount of one ingredient alone.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate immediately acts on all dissolved and free oxygen in water, and in a matter of seconds all oxygen is absorbed.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate does not act on dissolved solids. While they are in solution, they are harmless. However, as they come out of solution in the crystalline form and are in a position to form scale, the D.M. Concentrate as a colloidal suspension immediately coats the crystals as they start to form with a Monomolecular, non-adherent, colloidal &quot;sheen&quot; preventing crystalline growth and crystalline adherence by distorting the crystal shape, so that they cannot form scale, but only finely divided sludge which is removed with normal blow-down.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate also chemically reacts with the underwater oxide surface of the various boiler tubes, boiler walls, and the tube sheets forming an inert tannate/ferric &quot;sheen&quot;. This &quot;sheen&quot; gives absolutely no thermal insulation. However, by covering the anode of the iron and changing the oxide cathodes to an inert tannate, existing galvanic corrosion is sealed off and future galvanic corrosion prevented, both by anodic and cathodic protection up to 2 Volts D.C.<br>
<br>
The carefully calculated formulation of D.M. Concentrate and the interaction of its components render its action more effective than the action produced by any single tannin.<br>
<br>
Although D.M. Concentrate may appear to cost more per quart or gallon than other boiler treatments on the market, it must be <br>
remembered that D.M. is a CONCENTRATE. By manufacturing D.M. Concentrate ourselves, under our own control and supervision. <br>
The true test of the economy of a treatment is not the price per quart but how many thousand gallons of steam producing water <br>
that quart will treat. Also, how effectively it maintains the boiler in proper condition and eliminates continuous and costly down time and maintenance. The average dosage is up to 5 oz. per 1,000 gallons of make-up water.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br>
<br>
1. D.M. Concentrate prevents hardness and other scale forming substances in solution or suspended matter entering the boiler with the feed water from adhering to the heated surfaces and a scale free boiler is maintained.<br>
<br>
2. Silica, by the action of D.M. Concentrate is prevented from complexing with iron, alumina and hardness salts to form silicate scales.<br>
<br>
3. Oxygen is absorbed in the boiler and pre-boiler parts of the system.<br>
<br>
4. Active corrosion is arrested and incidence of further corrosion is prevented by the formation of the tannate/ferric <br>
oxide on underwater surfaces.<br>
<br>
5. D.M. Concentrate reacts with any free iron in suspension to produce a tannate-iron oxide complex which counteracts its tendency to adhere to heated surfaces, particularly so when the surface has been changed by D.M. Concentrate to the tannate/ferric surface. This iron or iron oxide in suspension may have come from pick-up in the feed system or other systems external to the boiler.<br>
<br>
6. The addition of D.M. Concentrate forming a colloidal suspension does not appreciably increase the total dissolved solids of the boiler water necessitating a greatly increased blow down. Over dosing of D.M. Concentrate can do no harm as the D.M. Concentrate in the boiler water is a reserve for future need, and this is merely increasing the reserve.  D.M. Concentrate will not carry over with steam.<br>
<br>
Conventional chemical treatments usually based on phosphate and soda themselves contribute substantially to the total dissolved solids of the boiler water materially increasing the necessary blow down. They often change the boiler&#39;s action into not only being a boiler, but having to be a softening plant as well. The amount of alkalinity necessary to do the softening job, sometimes increases the T.D.S. and the alkalinity to the point where foaming and priming are likely -especially when sudden changes in the boiler load take place. With D.M., alkaline chemicals are only used to raise the pH to between 9.5 to 10 (this is below the T.D.S. and alkalinity limits, where priming or foaming is likely). They eliminate any possibility of acid corrosion and the D.M. Concentrate goes further and has greater oxygen absorption ability in alkaline waters. By using our conjunctional treatments with D.M., the amount of D.M. Concentrate used is slightly lowered.<br>
<br>
7. D.M. Concentrate itself tends to inhibit caustic embrittlement. In any conjunctional treatment we supply for use with D.M. Concentrate in which there is caustic there is enough nitrate mixed with the caustic to insure that the caustic-nitrate ratio is above that needed to prevent caustic embrittlement.<br>
<br>
8. D.M. Concentrate is non-toxic, non-caustic and is absolutely safe to handle and store.  D.M. Concentrate is COMPLETELY <br>
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.<br>
<br>
9. Administration of the treatment is safe and simple. The testing procedure is positive and simple and is more easily and more quickly carried out by boiler room personnel.<br>
<br>
10. The action of D.M. Concentrate in scale prevention is physical or mechanical - not chemical, with the result that D.M. Concentrate may be used to prevent scale formation in any type of water.<br>
<br>
As the action of D.M. Concentrate on suspended Matter or dissolved solids as they come out of solution is mechanical, the D.M. Concentrate does not differentiate between silica and calcium sulphate for instance. It is equally efficient in protection against every kind of scale, from all types of water.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate has little effect on pH value. It is non-alkaline and about as acid as a &quot;good cup of tea&quot;.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be used in boiler pressures where the temperature and pressure are high enough to render sodium sulphite unsafe, as sodium sulphite will, at these temperatures and pressures, possibly form sulphuric or sulphurous acid.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be, and should be, used after softening plants or any type of pre-treatment. The amount of D.M. Concentrate used will naturally be greatly lowered. The D.M. Concentrate reserve in the water is there when needed to treat any residual hardness or any residual oxygen that may come over due to any maloperation of the pre-treated plant or sudden increased demands above its designed flow rate.<br>

                            STEAM BOILERS AND GENERATORS WATER TREATMENT<br>
<br>
1- Corrosion Control and Scale Inhibitor<br>
<br>
Based on a blend of carefully selected tannins for use in steam raising boilers and generators. provides both corrosion protection, scale inhibition, oxygen scavenging , forming a protective film and disrupting the crystal growth. <br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate also prevents galvanic or electrolytic corrosion up to 2 volts and conditions the sludge.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT FOR STEAM SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate is composed of several different organic tannins, both natural and synthetic. The formulation was carefully compounded to give the highest efficiency with all types of water in high, low and medium pressure boilers. It is also the ideal treatment for any residual hardness or residual oxygen, which may carry over from pre-treatment. The various components of THERMITAN Concentrate have been selected for their exceptional stability under all boiler conditions.<br>
<br>
All the various organic components act in oxygen absorption, in forming a light flocculent sludge instead of scale, and in changing the oxide surface of all underwater ferrous substances to tannen/ferric complex. Some are better than others as oxygen scavengers. Some are better than others in forming sludge. Some in keeping it finely divided and flocculent. However, all work together as a team to produce the finest results. In many cases, one or two act as catalysts on each other. Blended together giving better results than the same amount of one ingredient alone.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate immediately acts on all dissolved and free oxygen in water, and in a matter of seconds all oxygen is absorbed.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate does not act on dissolved solids. While they are in solution, they are harmless. However, as they come out of solution in the crystalline form and are in a position to form scale, the THERMITAN Concentrate as a colloidal suspension immediately coats the crystals as they start to form with a Monomolecular, non-adherent, colloidal &quot;sheen&quot; preventing crystalline growth and crystalline adherence by distorting the crystal shape, so that they cannot form scale, but only finely divided sludge which is removed with normal blow-down.<br>
<br>
The THERMITAN Concentrate also chemically reacts with the underwater oxide surface of the various boiler tubes, boiler walls, and the <br>
tube sheets forming an inert tannate/ferric &quot;sheen&quot;. This &quot;sheen&quot; gives absolutely no thermal insulation. However, by covering the anode of the iron and changing the oxide cathodes to an inert tannate, existing galvanic corrosion is sealed off and future galvanic corrosion prevented, both by anodic and cathodic protection up to 2 Volts D.C.<br>
<br>
The carefully calculated formulation of THERMITAN Concentrate and the interaction of its components render its action more effective <br>
than the action produced by any single tannin. <br>
<br>
Although THERMITAN Concentrate may appear to cost more per quart or gallon than other boiler treatments on the market, it must be <br>
remembered that THERMITAN is a CONCENTRATE. By manufacturing D.M. Concentrate ourselves, under our own control and supervision. <br>
<br>
The true test of the economy of a treatment is not the price per quart but how many thousand gallons of steam producing water that quart will treat. Also, how effectively it maintains the boiler in proper condition and eliminates continuous and costly down time and maintenance. The average dosage is up to 5 oz. per 1,000 gallons of make-up water.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THERMITAN CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br>
<br>
1. THERMITAN Concentrate prevents hardness and other scale forming substances in solution or suspended matter entering the boiler <br>
with the feed water from adhering to the heated surfaces and a scale free boiler is maintained.<br>
<br>
2. Silica, by the action of THERMITAN Concentrate is prevented from complexing with iron, alumina and hardness salts to form <br>
silicate scales.<br>
<br>
3. Oxygen is absorbed in the boiler and pre-boiler parts of the system.<br>
<br>
4. Active corrosion is arrested and incidence of further corrosion is prevented by the formation of the tannate/ferric <br>
oxide on underwater surfaces.<br>
<br>
5. THERMITAN Concentrate reacts with any free iron in suspension to produce a tannate-iron oxide complex which counteracts its <br>
tendency to adhere to heated surfaces, particularly so when the surface has been changed by THERMITAN Concentrate to the tannate/ferric surface. This iron or iron oxide in suspension may have come from pick-up in the feed system or other systems external to the boiler.<br>
<br>
6. The addition of THERMITAN Concentrate forming a colloidal suspension does not appreciably increase the total dissolved solids of the boiler water necessitating a greatly increased blow down. Over dosing of THERMITAN Concentrate can do no harm as the THERMITAN Concentrate in the boiler water is a reserve for future need, and this is merely increasing the reserve.  <br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate will not carry over with steam.<br>
<br>
Conventional chemical treatments usually based on phosphate and soda themselves contribute substantially to the total dissolved <br>
solids of the boiler water materially increasing the necessary blow down. They often change the boiler&#39;s action into not only being a boiler, but having to be a softening plant as well. The amount of alkalinity necessary to do the softening job, sometimes increases the T.D.S. and the alkalinity to the point where foaming and priming are likely -especially when sudden changes in the boiler load take place. With THERMITAN., alkaline chemicals are only used to raise the pH to between 9.5 to 10 (this is below the T.D.S. and alkalinity limits, where priming or foaming is likely). They eliminate any possibility of acid corrosion and the THERMITAN Concentrate goes further and has greater oxygen absorption ability in alkaline waters. <br>
<br>
By using our conjunctional treatments with THERMITAN., the amount of THERMITAN Concentrate used is slightly lowered.<br>
<br>
7. THERMITAN Concentrate itself tends to inhibit caustic embrittlement. In any conjunctional treatment we supply for use with THERMITAN Concentrate in which there is caustic there is enough nitrate mixed with the caustic to insure that the caustic-<br>
nitrate ratio is above that needed to prevent caustic embrittlement.<br>
<br>
8. THERMITAN Concentrate is non-toxic, non-caustic and is absolutely safe to handle and store.  THERMITAN is COMPLETELY <br>
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.<br>
<br>
9. Administration of the treatment is safe and simple. The testing procedure is positive and simple and is more easily and <br>
more quickly carried out by boiler room personnel.<br>
<br>
10. The action of THERMITAN Concentrate in scale prevention is physical or mechanical - not chemical, with the result that D.M. <br>
Concentrate may be used to prevent scale formation in any type of water.<br>
<br>
As the action of THERMITAN Concentrate on suspended Matter or dissolved solids as they come out of solution is mechanical, the <br>
D.M. Concentrate does not differentiate between silica and calcium sulphate for instance. It is equally efficient in protection against every kind of scale, from all types of water.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate has little effect on pH value. It is non-alkaline and about as acid as a &quot;good cup of tea&quot;.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate can be used in boiler pressures where the temperature and pressure are high enough to render sodium <br>
sulphite unsafe, as sodium sulphite will, at these temperatures and pressures, possibly form sulphuric or sulphurous acid.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate can be, and should be, used after softening plants or any type of pre-treatment. The amount of THERMITAN <br>
Concentrate used will naturally be greatly lowered. The THERMITAN. Concentrate reserve in the water is there when needed to treat <br>
any residual hardness or any residual oxygen that may come over due to any maloperation of the pre-treated plant or sudden <br>
increased demands above its designed flow rate.<br>

                            * TEFLON BASE LUBRICANT, SEALANT:<br>
<br>
For pipe threads and gaskets works as an anti seize lubricant and sealant, sealant, effective for use in up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit and pressure up to 20,000 PSI.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE has been developed as an all-purpose lubricant and sealant. TETRA-LUBE has been made for applications that require the best lubrication available. TETRA-LUBE processing and formulation enables it to provide a versatility not found in conventional lubricants.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is made with DuPont&#39;s &quot;TEFLON&quot; 1 which is inert and unaffected by acids, oils, caustics, aviation gasoline and common solvents. It is used in applications with temperatures up to 6000F, and displays one of the lowest coefficients of friction and anti-stick properties of any known material. As can be seen, TETRA-LUBE characteristics surpass the many conventional lubricants in overall performance.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is packaged in a concentrated form for immediate use with demanding and difficult lubrication requirements. <br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE gives that long lasting protection to the coated parts which keeps equipment in top operating condition. Equipment that <br>
has been in operation for some time will begin to perform as it did when first put into operation. Machining equipment such as lathes, illustrates one application where the application of <br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE provides superior service. Equipment such as this demands the best lubricant available, since precision work requires smooth operational control.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is recommended for the lubrication requirements of equipment that must be operated over extended periods of time and where shutdowns are prohibitive. TETRA-LUBE provides the superior lubrication and continuous service that is needed. Equipment will operate with the highest degree of efficiency and equipment wear will be reduced to a minimum. The loss of lubricant will be arrested through the unique sealing characteristics of TETRA-LUBE.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is mixed with conventional oils and greases by users who wish to increase the lubricity and protection to coated parts. As little as one ounce of TETRA-LUBE may be added to a quart of any conventional lubricant to enjoy this additional protection and lubricity. Applications such as gear and chain drive units gearboxes, draw works, engine drive groups and direct rotary drives are excellent examples of TETRA-Lubes use in this manner. Not only is superior lubrication obtained, but also heat generation is reduced and maintenance is kept at a minimum.<br>
<br>
In addition to superior lubrication and protection of coated parts, TETRA-LUBE provides and additional service as a sealant. This is just one more example of TETRA-LUBE superiority in comparison with other lubricants on the market. Not only is the best lubrication where you need it, but it absolutely reduces leakage. Application of TETRA-LUBE to valves and to threaded connections eliminates leakage and allows parts to be broken out without galling and seizing.<br>
<br>
Metal surfaces consist of a series of high and low points of contact. Friction generates from the contact of these conflicting points and the force required to push one surface through another. TETRA-LUBE overcomes and decreases this phenomenon by filling the low areas, making the metal surfaces a surface of TETRA-LUBE. The prevention of metal-to-metal contact provides superior lubrication and TETRA-LUBE provides this prevention in the most efficient and economical manner possible.<br>
<br>
TETRA-LUBE is available in six grades, filling the complete range of applications.<br>
<br>
L1 FORMULA 350: In liquid form, for lighter applications, including small pipe threads.Not recommended for packing.<br>
<br>

(POWDER OR LIQUID)<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C. is used in conjunction with D.M. CONCENTRATE where the water is high in temporary or carbonate hardness. C.T.N.C. <br>
functions are the same as C.T.B. to raise the pH of the boiler water, however, it is more efficient with water of temporary <br>
hardness than C.T.B.<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C. contains caustic and should be treated with care. However, it has inhibitors against caustic embrittlement which <br>
are more than adequate. D.M. CONCENTRATE itself is also an inhibitor against caustic embrittlement. C.T.N.C. will absorb <br>
some carbon dioxide in the water but it is not complete protection for return lines against carbon dioxide corrosion. <br>
Nothing will give complete return line corrosion protection except one of our product Neutratherm neutralizing amine,or <br>
Thermafilm filming amine. However, C.T.N.C. materially aids in this protection.<br>
<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.N.C. POWDER is 500-mg powder for each 1000 litters of raw make-up. <br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.N.C. LIQUID is approximately 20 oz. (590 ml) per 250 gallons of raw feed. Maintain boiler water pH between 9 and 10 , check with Litmus (pH) paper. <br>

<br>
C.T.B. is a special mineral alkaline, blended for use with D.M. CONCENTRATE. It is used with distilled, demineralized or water high in permanent hardness. It is also recommended for use in dairies or other manufacturers of food products.<br>
<br>
None of the conjunctional treatments nor D.M. CONCENTRATE will carry over with the steam itself, however, if priming or foaming <br>
occurs in the boiler, water in the form of bubbles is carried over. The D.M. or C.T.B. in that bubble water will naturally go <br>
over too. Neither D.M. CONCENTRATE nor C.T.B. is toxic.<br>
<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.B. POWDER is 2.2 Lb. (1 Kg) of C.T.B. powder for every 1000 litters of raw make-up.<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.B. LIQUID is approximately 40 oz (1136 ml) per 250 gallons of raw make-up. Maintain bubble water pH between 9 and 10, check with Litmus (pH) paper.<br>

                            STEAM BOILERS AND GENERATORS WATER TREATMENT<br>
<br>
1- Corrosion Control and Scale Inhibitor<br>
<br>
Based on a blend of carefully selected tannins for use in steam raising boilers and generators. provides both corrosion protection, scale inhibition, oxygen scavenging , forming a protective film and disrupting the crystal growth. <br>
<br>
D.M.Concentrate also prevents galvanic or electrolytic corrosion up to 2 volts and conditions the sludge.<br>
<br>
D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT FOR STEAM SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate is composed of several different organic tannins, both natural and synthetic. The formulation was carefully compounded to give the highest efficiency with all types of water in high, low and medium pressure boilers. It is also the ideal treatment for any residual hardness or residual oxygen, which may carry over from pre-treatment. The various components of D.M. Concentrate have been selected for their exceptional stability under all boiler conditions.<br>
<br>
All the various organic components act in oxygen absorption, in forming a light flocculent sludge instead of scale, and in changing the oxide surface of all underwater ferrous substances to tannen/ferric complex. Some are better than others as oxygen scavengers. Some are better than others in forming sludge. Some in keeping it finely divided and flocculent. However, all work together as a team to produce the finest results. In many cases, one or two act as catalysts on each other. Blended together giving better results than the same amount of one ingredient alone.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate immediately acts on all dissolved and free oxygen in water, and in a matter of seconds all oxygen is absorbed.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate does not act on dissolved solids. While they are in solution, they are harmless. However, as they come out of solution in the crystalline form and are in a position to form scale, the D.M. Concentrate as a colloidal suspension immediately coats the crystals as they start to form with a Monomolecular, non-adherent, colloidal &quot;sheen&quot; preventing crystalline growth and crystalline adherence by distorting the crystal shape, so that they cannot form scale, but only finely divided sludge which is removed with normal blow-down.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate also chemically reacts with the underwater oxide surface of the various boiler tubes, boiler walls, and the tube sheets forming an inert tannate/ferric &quot;sheen&quot;. This &quot;sheen&quot; gives absolutely no thermal insulation. However, by <br>
covering the anode of the iron and changing the oxide cathodes to an inert tannate, existing galvanic corrosion is sealed off and future galvanic corrosion prevented, both by anodic and cathodic protection up to 2 Volts D.C.<br>
<br>
The carefully calculated formulation of D.M. Concentrate and the interaction of its components render its action more effective than the action produced by any single tannin. Although D.M. Concentrate may appear to cost more per quart or gallon than other boiler treatments on the market, it must be remembered that D.M. is a CONCENTRATE. By manufacturing D.M. Concentrate ourselves, under our own control and supervision. The true test of the economy of a treatment is not the price per quart but how many thousand gallons of steam producing water that quart will treat. Also, how effectively it maintains the boiler in proper condition and eliminates continuous and costly down time and maintenance. The average dosage is up to 5 oz. per 1,000 gallons of make-up water.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br>
<br>
1. D.M. Concentrate prevents hardness and other scale forming substances in solution or suspended matter entering the boiler with the feed water from adhering to the heated surfaces and a scale free boiler is maintained.<br>
<br>
2. Silica, by the action of D.M. Concentrate is prevented from complexing with iron, alumina and hardness salts to form silicate scales.<br>
<br>
3. Oxygen is absorbed in the boiler and pre-boiler parts of the system.<br>
<br>
4. Active corrosion is arrested and incidence of further corrosion is prevented by the formation of the tannate/ferric oxide on underwater surfaces.<br>
<br>
5. D.M. Concentrate reacts with any free iron in suspension to produce a tannate-iron oxide complex which counteracts its tendency to adhere to heated surfaces, particularly so when the surface has been changed by D.M. Concentrate to the tannate/ferric surface. This iron or iron oxide in suspension may have come from pick-up in the feed system or other systems external to the boiler.<br>
<br>
6. The addition of D.M. Concentrate forming a colloidal suspension does not appreciably increase the total dissolved solids of the boiler water necessitating a greatly increased blow down. Over dosing of D.M. Concentrate can do no harm as the D.M. Concentrate in the boiler water is a reserve for future need, and this is merely increasing the reserve.  <br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate will not carry over with steam.<br>
<br>
Conventional chemical treatments usually based on phosphate and soda themselves contribute substantially to the total dissolved solids of the boiler water materially increasing the necessary blow down. They often change the boiler&#39;s action into not only being a boiler, but having to be a softening plant as well. The amount of alkalinity necessary to do the softening job, sometimes increases the T.D.S. and the alkalinity to the point where foaming and priming are likely -especially when sudden changes in the boiler load take place. With D.M., alkaline chemicals are only used to raise the pH to between 9.5 to 10 (this is below the T.D.S. and alkalinity limits, where priming or foaming is likely). They eliminate any possibility of acid corrosion and the D.M. Concentrate goes further and has greater oxygen absorption ability in alkaline waters. By using our conjunctional treatments with D.M., the amount of D.M. Concentrate used is slightly lowered.<br>
<br>
7. D.M. Concentrate itself tends to inhibit caustic embrittlement. In any conjunctional treatment we supply for use with D.M. Concentrate in which there is caustic there is enough nitrate mixed with the caustic to insure that the caustic-nitrate ratio is above that needed to prevent caustic embrittlement.<br>
<br>
8. D.M. Concentrate is non-toxic, non-caustic and is absolutely safe to handle and store.  D.M. Concentrate is COMPLETELY <br>
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.<br>
<br>
9. Administration of the treatment is safe and simple. The testing procedure is positive and simple and is more easily and more quickly carried out by boiler room personnel.<br>
<br>
10. The action of D.M. Concentrate in scale prevention is physical or mechanical - not chemical, with the result that D.M. Concentrate may be used to prevent scale formation in any type of water.<br>
<br>
As the action of D.M. Concentrate on suspended Matter or dissolved solids as they come out of solution is mechanical, the D.M. Concentrate does not differentiate between silica and calcium sulphate for instance. It is equally efficient in protection against every kind of scale, from all types of water.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate has little effect on pH value. It is non-alkaline and about as acid as a &quot;good cup of tea&quot;.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be used in boiler pressures where the temperature and pressure are high enough to render sodium sulphite unsafe, as sodium sulphite will, at these temperatures and pressures, possibly form sulphuric or sulphurous acid.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be, and should be, used after softening plants or any type of pre-treatment. The amount of D.M. Concentrate used will naturally be greatly lowered. The D.M. Concentrate reserve in the water is there when needed to treat any residual hardness or any residual oxygen that may come over due to any maloperation of the pre-treated plant or sudden increased demands above its designed flow rate.<br>
<br>
2- pH Control For Steam Boilers<br>
<br>
Specially formulated to control and rise the pH in the boiler water.<br>
<br>
CONJUNCTIONAL TREATMENT (POWDER OR LIQUID)<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C. is used in conjunction with D.M. CONCENTRATE where the water is high in temporary or carbonate hardness. C.T.N.C. functions are the same as C.T.B. to raise the pH of the boiler water, however, it is more efficient with water of temporary <br>
hardness than C.T.B.<br>
<br>
C.T.N.C. contains caustic and should be treated with care. However, it has inhibitors against caustic embrittlement which are more than adequate. D.M. CONCENTRATE itself is also an inhibitor against caustic embrittlement. C.T.N.C. will absorb some carbon dioxide in the water but it is not complete protection for return lines against carbon dioxide corrosion. Nothing will give complete return line corrosion protection except one of our product Neutratherm neutralizing amine,or Thermafilm filming amine. However, C.T.N.C. materially aids in this protection.<br>
<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.N.C. POWDER is 500-mg powder for each 1000 litters of raw make-up. <br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.N.C. LIQUID is approximately 20 oz. (590 ml) per 250 gallons of raw feed. Maintain boiler water pH between 9 and 10 , check with Litmus (pH) paper. <br>
<br>
C.T.B<br>
<br>
C.T.B. is a special mineral alkaline, blended for use with D.M. CONCENTRATE. It is used with distilled, demineralized or water high in permanent hardness. It is also recommended for use in dairies or other manufacturers of food products.<br>
<br>
None of the conjunctional treatments nor D.M. CONCENTRATE will carry over with the steam itself, however, if priming or foaming <br>
occurs in the boiler, water in the form of bubbles is carried over. The D.M. or C.T.B. in that bubble water will naturally go over too. Neither D.M. CONCENTRATE nor C.T.B. is toxic.<br>
<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.B. POWDER is 2.2 Lb. (1 Kg) of C.T.B. powder for every 1000 litters of raw make-up.<br>
NORMAL DOSAGE for C.T.B. LIQUID is approximately 40 oz (1136 ml) per 250 gallons of raw make-up. Maintain bubble water pH between 9 and 10, check with Litmus (pH). paper.<br>

3- Condensate Return Line Treatment<br>
<br>
Whether it neutralizing amines, filming amines or a combination of both, you can be assured that the program we recommend will <br>
be the best one for your system.<br>
<br>
NEUTRATHERM<br>
<br>
Description And Use<br>
<br>
Neutratherm is a liquid neutralizing amine, approximately 99% active material, and is used to prevent corrosion in the steam condensate  systems.<br>
<br>
Treatment And Dosage<br>
<br>
The optimum treatment level for Neutratherm depends on factors such as: the condensate pH and operating conditions. The product should be used in accordance with the control procedures established by Thermidaire Corporation for specific systems.<br>
<br>
The dosage of Neutratherm depends on the amount of free and  Bicarbonate CO2 in feed water, Usually is 2.5 Lb. of Neutratherm <br>
per million Lb. of steam generated.<br>
<br>
Neutratherm is volatile and it should be injected to the boiler as close as possible. It can be fed to the boiler or directly to the steam header.<br>
<br>
benefits<br>
<br>
Prevents corrosion due to dissolved CO2<br>
Prevents Corrosion due to dissolved O2<br>
On-site tests allow a correct monitoring<br>
May aid thermal efficiency.<br>
<br>
Neutratherm is based on a blend of amines <br>
<br>
THERMAFILM<br>
<br>
Description And Use<br>
<br>
Thermafilm is a complex organic material, filming amine, used to prevent corrosion in steam condensate systems by forming a film <br>
on the metal surfaces. The film also promotes a drop wise condensation and therefore improves the thermal efficiency.<br>
<br>
Treatment And Dosage<br>
<br>
The optimum treatment levels for Thermafilm depend on factors such as the condensate pH and operating conditions.<br>
<br>
Thermafilm can be fed into the boiler through the feed water line, the boiler drum the condensate return tank or through the steam header. Continuous feed into the steam line is desired but shot feeding is acceptable where the make-up requirements are less than 20%.<br>
<br>
The injection into the teed water or boiler water is acceptable in certain circumstances.<br>
<br>
The product should be used in accordance with the control procedures established by Thermidaire Corporation for the specific systems.<br>
<br>
Thermafilm should be diluted with 60-1150F condensate water (preferably raw water), softened water. Feed water or boiler water should not be used for this purpose.<br>
<br>
Thermafilm should not be mixed with other treating chemicals in the same feed tank or with water which has a pH level above 9.0<br>
<br>
Benefits<br>
<br>
Prevents corrosion due to dissolved CO2.<br>
Prevents corrosion due to dissolved O2.<br>
On-site control tests allow a correct monitoring.<br>
May aid thermal efficiency.<br>
Thermafilm is based on long chain fatty primary amines<br>
<br>
APPLICATION OF NEUTRATHERM AND THERMAFILM<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s have a close look at the properties, application and limitations of our two steam and return line corrosion control products.<br>
<br>
NEUTRATHERM<br>
<br>
This product is a 99% active dispersion of a complex alkaline amine. When fed to the boiler it volatizes over with the steam and condenses in the condensate, raising the pH above 7.0, thereby neutralizing the carbonic acid formed when carbon dioxide condenses with steam. This product protects against CARBON DIOXIDE CORROSION ONLY. If oxygen is present in the steam and condensate, pitting type corrosion can still occur, although the severity of oxygen attack is minimized at pH&#39;s above 7.0 <br>
<br>
Because Neutratherm is volatile and vaporizes at elevated temperatures, it should be fed through a chemical pot feeder as close to the boiler as possible. Avoid feeding to hot condensate tanks, or a good portion of the Neutratherm will be lost to atmosphere before reaching the boiler.<br>
<br>
THERMAFILM<br>
<br>
This product protects steam and condensate lines against BOTH carbon dioxide and oxygen corrosion. Thermafilm is a filming type amine.<br>
<br>
Although this product is alkaline, it affords protection to the steam and return condensate system, not by raising pH but by forming impervious non-wettable film on the interior metal pipe walls. This creates a film-type barrier against the corrosive action of oxygen and carbon dioxide.<br>
<br>
Thermafilm must be fed continuously and separately from other chemicals. It must be mixed in warm condensate, never above pH <br>
9.0. Over-dosing must be avoided since this will cause the Octadecylamine to separate in the steam and &quot;Gunk&quot; out in the system as a sticky, gummy precipitate. Please refer all Thermafilm proposals to Head Office for review.<br>
<br>
Both Thermafilm and Neutratherm have a highly detergent action in removing existing iron oxide deposits in lines and traps. <br>
<br>
Initial dosages should be kept to a minimum when treating older systems.<br>

                            *S.H.W HOT AND CHILLED WATERS SYSTEMS (CLOSED LOOP) WATER TREATMENT <br>
<br>
To inhibit corrosion, disperse solids and selectively protect integral components of your closed water &amp; chilled water systems <br>
we offer numerous easy to monitor programs designed with operator convenience in mind.<br>
<br>
S.H.W CONCENTRATE  <br>
<br>
S.H.W.  is a complex colourless water treatment for hot and chilled water systems, to control and protect  corrosion in hot <br>
and cold water systems. and will last for more than 3 years in closed systems.<br>
<br>
A thin tenacious film is formed on the metal surface. This film does not build up on itself to form a scale, and therefore does <br>
not obstruct the flow of water, nor is the transfer of heat affected in anyway.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  does not depend on alkalinity or the pH value of the water, but is dependent on the silica content of the silicate. Protection is obtainable in waters that are both acid and slightly alkaline up to a pH of 8.5.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  is effective with,<br>
<br>
Iron; Steel; Galvanized Iron; Red Brass; Yellow Brass; Copper; Bronze; Nickel alloys and Zinc. It is also effective with one or more of these metals used in conjunction with another, which normally would cause galvanic action.<br>
<br>
Directions<br>
<br>
Add:  1 gallon for each 1000 gallons of water in the system. OR 1 pint for every 1000 sq. foot of heating  surface (for schools and apartment buildings). Control may be checked by a silica (Si) reading keeping it between  35 PPM to 40 PPM.  Should water turn reddish, empty system.  Flash and refill with same initial dosage.  Some  areas require this to be done 2 or 3 times.  The reddish colour is from the removal of iron oxides. <br>
<br>
S.H.W. film starts forming immediately at the point of application, gradually extending through the complete  system. For long rambling systems it could take up to 30 days to have a film on the entire system.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  may be fed through pot feeders or proportioning pumps. The latter should be diluted at a ratio of 1:1.<br>
<br>
Advantages of S.H.W<br>
<br>
  1. It is inexpensive and simple to use.<br>
  2. Frequent water analyses are not necessary. At the  commencement once a week, after three months, once a month should be sufficient.<br>
  3. Film cannot build up to form a scale, or impede the water flow.<br>
  4. Film does not affect heat transfer.<br>
  5. Water hardness is not increased.<br>
  6. S.H.W. is effective in the pH range of 8 to 8.5 (normal)<br>
  7. As a result, pH need not be raised to higher levels to assure efficiency.<br>
  8. It is harmless, and non-toxic.<br>
  9. Will last up to 3 years in closed system.<br>

<br>
H.D. POWDER &amp; LIQUID<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION AND USE<br>
<br>
H.D. is a non-caustic, powder degreasing soluble in hot water, incorporating a blend of alkalis with suitable wettants.<br>
<br>
H.D. is non-corrosive to ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Extra care should be given when cleaning aluminum and its alloys.<br>
<br>
H.D. removes greasy and oil bound deposits from all surfaces and it is applied to condensers, oil coolers, engine and compressor water jackets, air coolers, engine parts lubricating the oil systems, pavement and concrete, and it is widely used for degreasing the new boilers and removing the oil contamination from the boiler feed water lines as well as the chilled water systems.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT AND DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
H.D. powder should be dissolved in hot water at a temperature of approximately 1500F. H.D. is used at a ratio of 15 Lb. for each 200 gallons of water in the boiler and/or system.<br>
<br>
For other use, the solution concentration depends on the nature of the deposits and on the type of the plant (range 1-10%).<br>
<br>
When cleaning aluminum or its alloys H.D. should be used at ambient temperature and not more than 5% strength.<br>
<br>
H.D. in a liquid form can be poured directly into the boiler through the manhole or valve cover opening, or circulated by an <br>
independent pump. The tank surfaces should be frequently scammed.<br>
<br>
H.D. treatment should be followed by a hot water flushing procedure.<br>
<br>

<br>
THERMIZE<br>
<br>
Description And Use<br>
<br>
Thermize is a cationic based compound used for mud and oxides removal. It is high molecular weight, polymeric material functioning as a polyelectrolyte causing an agglomeration of the particles and in effect more flocculent, looser mud easy to remove by blowdown. Thermize is widely used for heating and cooling systems.<br>
<br>
THERMIZE is normally used along with boiler water treatment program or for thorough cleaning of the system during the shutdown period.<br>
<br>
Treatment And Dosage<br>
<br>
The correct application of Thermize will be given by Thermidaire Corporation and it is dependent of many factors, such as: the type and the characteristics of the operating system , and the purpose Thermize will be used for.<br>
<br>
For cooling systems the dosage will be 1 quart of Thermize per 100-ton capacity per week. For cleaning purposes Thermize should be used at a rate of 1 gallon per 1,000 gallons of water.<br>

DESCRIPTION AND USE<br>
<br>
S.F.C. is a sludge and foam product being a hydrophillic colloid, non-toxic substance that completely dissolves in water. <br>
<br>
S.F.C. reacts readily with metallic ions such as calcium and iron to form a large floc or colloidal precipitate of the metal. It will not attack nor dissolve the iron from the boiler shell, walls or tubes.<br>
<br>
S.F.C. is used for the carry-over prevention in boilers or evaporators and to remove the heavy sludge.<br>
<br>
TREATMENT AND DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
The amount of S.F.C. required will vary with different operating conditions from 1/2 to 3/4 oz. of diluted solution (4:1 per gallon of make-up water). S.F.C. should be diluted in a ratio (1 quart of S.F.C. to 3 quarts of tap water) and injected continuously to the suction of the boiler feed pump, or directly to the boiler for each gallon of feed water required.<br>
<br>
The optimum treatment level for any plant will be specified by Thermidaire Corporation and will be dependent upon the water <br>
parameters.<br>
<br>

<br>
Ingredients Procurement <br>
<br>
We depend on imports for a large portion of the raw materials we use in our products. We purchase from Canada and the United <br>
States, Each ingredient and production location is carefully selected, reflecting our stance that top-quality products can only be made using top-quality ingredients.<br>
<br>
Production <br>
<br>
The Company&#39;s fundamental policy is to set up production facilities close to where its products are consumed. Reflecting this policy, with this in mind, we are seeking the creation of new Joint ventures around the world. As part of our strategy to reduce procurement and production costs, we are planing to set up operations in Middle East, Europe, and the Far East. In the future, we intend to continue expanding our operations in China, Taiwan, Malaysia and other Asian nations in partnership with local companies.<br>
<br>
Diverse Research &amp; Development <br>
Initiatives To fortify our product development and basic research capabilities, we upgraded and expanded the functions of Thermidaire Research Laboratory, We added a swimming pool product development Centre and fine chemicals department to the existing technology research Centre. In these ways, we are working to quickly and accurately pinpoint market needs and develop new products, we have built an organisation that allows us to swiftly develop new products and improve existing ones. We now have a structure that facilitates our efforts to refine basic technologies and produce original R&amp;D achievements in the medium and long terms.<br>
<br>
Meeting International Standards <br>
<br>
Paralleling to the plans for global expansion of Thermidaire business is a need to meet international product quality and environmental standards. Since we manufacture and sell our products internationally, it is essential that we develop, manufacture and distribute products that fully meet global standards for quality, so our customers&#39; world-wide can use our products with peace of mind. To enhance awareness among customers of our product quality, we are raising our standards as part of a Company wide effort to secure certification under ISO 9002, an international standard for product quality. We are implementing new standards throughout our facilities. This has had a positive effect on our efforts to standardise other internal procedures, we earned official certification from <br>
Agriculture Canada for the use of our products in food establishment. New laws was enacted in most countries of the world as part of the nation&#39;s environmental protection initiative, We intend to develop our business while strictly adhering to domestic and international standards for product quality and environmental protection. To assure our ability to supply customers with quality, reliable, price-competitive products, we are reorganizing our production, distribution and marketing systems in North America and overseas.<br>
<br>
Production and Distribution <br>
<br>
Our production and distribution facility in Scarborough has been the Centre of the Company&#39;s operations for over 30 years. Due to <br>
the ageing of this facility, we have moved to temporary to our Mississauga sales location, we are working on constructing a new plant and distribution Centre in London, Ontario, which will become our operation Centre. We have set up distribution centres in Toronto, Scarborough, Mississauga, London, Barry, Niagara, Leamington (Ontario), Halifax (Nova Scotia), Edmonton, Calgary (Alberta), Vancouver (British Colombia), Sea Grit (New Jersey, USA), Tucson (Arizona USA), Buffalo New York  (USA). <br>
<br>
Marketing <br>
<br>
Due to growth of economy, industry, new building construction etc.  In North America in recent years, market demand for industrial water treatment chemicals have increased Responding to this situation, we restructured and strengthened our national and internal operations to enhance our marketing capabilities to meet expanding commercial, residential and industrial demands. <br>
<br>
This has allowed us to develop more carefully targeted products and respond more accurately to the demands of our distributors <br>
and customers, we conduct ongoing market research to determine market needs. We then analyse the collected data and use it to <br>
speed up product development and marketing activities. <br>
<br>
As part of our sales promotion efforts, we also hold water treatment classes. <br>
<br>
Our prices are set to be at least 30% lower than our competition.<br>

                            * HOT AND CHILLED WATERS SYSTEMS (CLOSED LOOP) WATER TREATMENT <br>
<br>
To inhibit corrosion, disperse solids and selectively protect integral components of your closed water &amp; chilled water systems <br>
we offer numerous easy to monitor programs designed with operator convenience in mind.<br>
<br>
S.H.W CONCENTRATE  <br>
<br>
S.H.W.  is a complex colourless water treatment for hot and chilled water systems, to control and protect  corrosion in hot <br>
and cold water systems. and will last for more than 3 years in closed systems.<br>
<br>
A thin tenacious film is formed on the metal surface. This film does not build up on itself to form a scale, and therefore does <br>
not obstruct the flow of water, nor is the transfer of heat affected in anyway.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  does not depend on alkalinity or the pH value of the water, but is dependent on the silica content of the silicate. Protection is obtainable in waters that are both acid and slightly alkaline up to a pH of 8.5.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  is effective with,<br>
<br>
Iron; Steel; Galvanized Iron; Red Brass; Yellow Brass; Copper; Bronze; Nickel alloys and Zinc. It is also effective with one or more of these metals used in conjunction with another, which normally would cause galvanic action.<br>
<br>
Directions<br>
<br>
Add:  1 gallon for each 1000 gallons of water in the system. OR 1 pint for every 1000 sq. foot of heating  surface (for schools and apartment buildings). Control may be checked by a silica (Si) reading keeping it between  35 PPM to 40 PPM.  Should water turn reddish, empty system.  Flash and refill with same initial dosage.  Some  areas require this to be done 2 or 3 times.  The reddish colour is from the removal of iron oxides. <br>
<br>
S.H.W. film starts forming immediately at the point of application, gradually extending through the complete  system. For long rambling systems it could take up to 30 days to have a film on the entire system.<br>
<br>
S.H.W.  may be fed through pot feeders or proportioning pumps. The latter should be diluted at a ratio of 1:1.<br>
<br>
Advantages of S.H.W<br>
<br>
  1. It is inexpensive and simple to use.<br>
  2. Frequent water analyses are not necessary. At the  commencement once a week, after three months, once a month should be sufficient.<br>
  3. Film cannot build up to form a scale, or impede the water flow.<br>
  4. Film does not affect heat transfer.<br>
  5. Water hardness is not increased.<br>
  6. S.H.W. is effective in the pH range of 8 to 8.5 (normal)<br>
  7. As a result, pH need not be raised to higher levels to assure efficiency.<br>
  8. It is harmless, and non-toxic.<br>
  9. Will last up to 3 years in closed system.<br>

                            STEAM BOILERS AND GENERATORS WATER TREATMENT<br>
<br>
Corrosion Control <br>
<br>
Based on a blend of carefully selected tannins for use in steam raising boilers and generators. provides both corrosion protection, scale inhibition, oxygen scavenging , forming a protective film and disrupting the crystal growth. <br>
<br>
D.M.Concentrate also prevents galvanic or electrolytic corrosion up to 2 volts and conditions the sludge.<br>
<br>
D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT FOR STEAM SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate is composed of several different organic tannins, both natural and synthetic. The formulation was carefully compounded to give the highest efficiency with all types of water in high, low and medium pressure boilers. It is also the ideal treatment for any residual hardness or residual oxygen, which may carry over from pre-treatment. The various components of D.M. Concentrate have been selected for their exceptional stability under all boiler conditions.<br>
<br>
All the various organic components act in oxygen absorption, in forming a light flocculent sludge instead of scale, and in changing the oxide surface of all underwater ferrous substances to tannen/ferric complex. Some are better than others as oxygen scavengers. Some are better than others in forming sludge. Some in keeping it finely divided and flocculent. However, all work together as a team to produce the finest results. In many cases, one or two act as catalysts on each other. Blended together giving better results than the same amount of one ingredient alone.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate immediately acts on all dissolved and free oxygen in water, and in a matter of seconds all oxygen is absorbed.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate does not act on dissolved solids. While they are in solution, they are harmless. However, as they come out of solution in the crystalline form and are in a position to form scale, the D.M. Concentrate as a colloidal suspension immediately coats the crystals as they start to form with a Monomolecular, non-adherent, colloidal &quot;sheen&quot; preventing crystalline growth and crystalline adherence by distorting the crystal shape, so that they cannot form scale, but only finely divided sludge which is removed with normal blow-down.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate also chemically reacts with the underwater oxide surface of the various boiler tubes, boiler walls, and the tube sheets forming an inert tannate/ferric &quot;sheen&quot;. This &quot;sheen&quot; gives absolutely no thermal insulation. However, by covering the anode of the iron and changing the oxide cathodes to an inert tannate, existing galvanic corrosion is sealed off and future galvanic corrosion prevented, both by anodic and cathodic protection up to 2 Volts D.C.<br>
<br>
The carefully calculated formulation of D.M. Concentrate and the interaction of its components render its action more effective than the action produced by any single tannin.<br>
<br>
Although D.M. Concentrate may appear to cost more per quart or gallon than other boiler treatments on the market, it must be remembered that D.M. is a CONCENTRATE. By manufacturing D.M. Concentrate ourselves, under our own control and supervision. <br>
<br>
The true test of the economy of a treatment is not the price per quart but how many thousand gallons of steam producing water that quart will treat. Also, how effectively it maintains the boiler in proper condition and eliminates continuous and costly down time and maintenance. The average dosage is up to 5 oz. per 1,000 gallons of make-up water.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br>
<br>
1. D.M. Concentrate prevents hardness and other scale forming substances in solution or suspended matter entering the boiler with the feed water from adhering to the heated surfaces and a scale free boiler is maintained.<br>
<br>
2. Silica, by the action of D.M. Concentrate is prevented from complexing with iron, alumina and hardness salts to form silicate scales.<br>
<br>
3. Oxygen is absorbed in the boiler and pre-boiler parts of the system.<br>
<br>
4. Active corrosion is arrested and incidence of further corrosion is prevented by the formation of the tannate/ferric oxide on underwater surfaces.<br>
<br>
5. D.M. Concentrate reacts with any free iron in suspension to produce a tannate-iron oxide complex which counteracts its tendency to adhere to heated surfaces, particularly so when the surface has been changed by D.M. Concentrate to the tannate/ferric surface. This iron or iron oxide in suspension may have come from pick-up in the feed system or other systems external to the boiler.<br>
<br>
6. The addition of D.M. Concentrate forming a colloidal suspension does not appreciably increase the total dissolved solids of the boiler water necessitating a greatly increased blow down. Over dosing of D.M. Concentrate can do no harm as the D.M. Concentrate in the boiler water is a reserve for future need, and this is merely increasing the reserve.  <br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate will not carry over with steam.<br>
<br>
Conventional chemical treatments usually based on phosphate and soda themselves contribute substantially to the total dissolved <br>
solids of the boiler water materially increasing the necessary blow down. They often change the boiler&#39;s action into not only being a boiler, but having to be a softening plant as well. The amount of alkalinity necessary to do the softening job, sometimes increases the T.D.S. and the alkalinity to the point where foaming and priming are likely -especially when sudden changes in the boiler load take place. With D.M., alkaline chemicals are only used to raise the pH to between 9.5 to 10 (this is below the T.D.S. and alkalinity limits, where priming or foaming is likely). They eliminate any possibility of acid corrosion and the D.M. Concentrate goes further and has greater oxygen absorption ability in alkaline waters. By using our conjunctional treatments with D.M., the amount of D.M. Concentrate used is slightly lowered.<br>
<br>
7. D.M. Concentrate itself tends to inhibit caustic embrittlement. In any conjunctional treatment we supply for use with D.M. Concentrate in which there is caustic there is enough nitrate mixed with the caustic to insure that the caustic-nitrate ratio is above that needed to prevent caustic embrittlement.<br>
<br>
8. D.M. Concentrate is non-toxic, non-caustic and is absolutely safe to handle and store.  D.M. Concentrate is COMPLETELY <br>
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.<br>
<br>
9. Administration of the treatment is safe and simple. The testing procedure is positive and simple and is more easily and more quickly carried out by boiler room personnel.<br>
<br>
10. The action of D.M. Concentrate in scale prevention is physical or mechanical - not chemical, with the result that D.M. Concentrate may be used to prevent scale formation in any type of water.<br>
<br>
As the action of D.M. Concentrate on suspended Matter or dissolved solids as they come out of solution is mechanical, the D.M. Concentrate does not differentiate between silica and calcium sulphate for instance. It is equally efficient in protection against every kind of scale, from all types of water.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate has little effect on pH value. It is non-alkaline and about as acid as a &quot;good cup of tea&quot;.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be used in boiler pressures where the temperature and pressure are high enough to render sodium sulphite unsafe, as sodium sulphite will, at these temperatures and pressures, possibly form sulphuric or sulphurous acid.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be, and should be, used after softening plants or any type of pre-treatment. The amount of D.M. Concentrate used will naturally be greatly lowered. The D.M. Concentrate reserve in the water is there when needed to treat any residual hardness or any residual oxygen that may come over due to any maloperation of the pre-treated plant or sudden increased demands above its designed flow rate.<br>

                            STEAM BOILERS AND GENERATORS WATER TREATMENT<br>
<br>
Scale Inhibitor<br>
<br>
Based on a blend of carefully selected tannins for use in steam raising boilers and generators. provides both corrosion protection, scale inhibition, oxygen scavenging , forming a protective film and disrupting the crystal growth. <br>
<br>
D.M.Concentrate also prevents galvanic or electrolytic corrosion up to 2 volts and conditions the sludge.<br>
<br>
D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT FOR STEAM SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate is composed of several different organic tannins, both natural and synthetic. The formulation was carefully compounded to give the highest efficiency with all types of water in high, low and medium pressure boilers. It is also the ideal treatment for any residual hardness or residual oxygen, which may carry over from pre-treatment. The various components of D.M. Concentrate have been selected for their exceptional stability under all boiler conditions.<br>
<br>
All the various organic components act in oxygen absorption, in forming a light flocculent sludge instead of scale, and in changing the oxide surface of all underwater ferrous substances to tannen/ferric complex. Some are better than others as oxygen scavengers. Some are better than others in forming sludge. Some in keeping it finely divided and flocculent. However, all work together as a team to produce the finest results. In many cases, one or two act as catalysts on each other. Blended together giving better results than the same amount of one ingredient alone.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate immediately acts on all dissolved and free oxygen in water, and in a matter of seconds all oxygen is absorbed.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate does not act on dissolved solids. While they are in solution, they are harmless. However, as they come out of solution in the crystalline form and are in a position to form scale, the D.M. Concentrate as a colloidal suspension immediately coats the crystals as they start to form with a Monomolecular, non-adherent, colloidal &quot;sheen&quot; preventing crystalline growth and crystalline adherence by distorting the crystal shape, so that they cannot form scale, but only finely divided sludge which is removed with normal blow-down.<br>
<br>
The D.M. Concentrate also chemically reacts with the underwater oxide surface of the various boiler tubes, boiler walls, and the tube sheets forming an inert tannate/ferric &quot;sheen&quot;. This &quot;sheen&quot; gives absolutely no thermal insulation. However, by covering the anode of the iron and changing the oxide cathodes to an inert tannate, existing galvanic corrosion is sealed off and future galvanic corrosion prevented, both by anodic and cathodic protection up to 2 Volts D.C.<br>
<br>
The carefully calculated formulation of D.M. Concentrate and the interaction of its components render its action more effective than the action produced by any single tannin.<br>
<br>
Although D.M. Concentrate may appear to cost more per quart or gallon than other boiler treatments on the market, it must be <br>
remembered that D.M. is a CONCENTRATE. By manufacturing D.M. Concentrate ourselves, under our own control and supervision. <br>
The true test of the economy of a treatment is not the price per quart but how many thousand gallons of steam producing water <br>
that quart will treat. Also, how effectively it maintains the boiler in proper condition and eliminates continuous and costly down time and maintenance. The average dosage is up to 5 oz. per 1,000 gallons of make-up water.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF D.M. CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br>
<br>
1. D.M. Concentrate prevents hardness and other scale forming substances in solution or suspended matter entering the boiler with the feed water from adhering to the heated surfaces and a scale free boiler is maintained.<br>
<br>
2. Silica, by the action of D.M. Concentrate is prevented from complexing with iron, alumina and hardness salts to form silicate scales.<br>
<br>
3. Oxygen is absorbed in the boiler and pre-boiler parts of the system.<br>
<br>
4. Active corrosion is arrested and incidence of further corrosion is prevented by the formation of the tannate/ferric <br>
oxide on underwater surfaces.<br>
<br>
5. D.M. Concentrate reacts with any free iron in suspension to produce a tannate-iron oxide complex which counteracts its tendency to adhere to heated surfaces, particularly so when the surface has been changed by D.M. Concentrate to the tannate/ferric surface. This iron or iron oxide in suspension may have come from pick-up in the feed system or other systems external to the boiler.<br>
<br>
6. The addition of D.M. Concentrate forming a colloidal suspension does not appreciably increase the total dissolved solids of the boiler water necessitating a greatly increased blow down. Over dosing of D.M. Concentrate can do no harm as the D.M. Concentrate in the boiler water is a reserve for future need, and this is merely increasing the reserve.  D.M. Concentrate will not carry over with steam.<br>
<br>
Conventional chemical treatments usually based on phosphate and soda themselves contribute substantially to the total dissolved solids of the boiler water materially increasing the necessary blow down. They often change the boiler&#39;s action into not only being a boiler, but having to be a softening plant as well. The amount of alkalinity necessary to do the softening job, sometimes increases the T.D.S. and the alkalinity to the point where foaming and priming are likely -especially when sudden changes in the boiler load take place. With D.M., alkaline chemicals are only used to raise the pH to between 9.5 to 10 (this is below the T.D.S. and alkalinity limits, where priming or foaming is likely). They eliminate any possibility of acid corrosion and the D.M. Concentrate goes further and has greater oxygen absorption ability in alkaline waters. By using our conjunctional treatments with D.M., the amount of D.M. Concentrate used is slightly lowered.<br>
<br>
7. D.M. Concentrate itself tends to inhibit caustic embrittlement. In any conjunctional treatment we supply for use with D.M. Concentrate in which there is caustic there is enough nitrate mixed with the caustic to insure that the caustic-nitrate ratio is above that needed to prevent caustic embrittlement.<br>
<br>
8. D.M. Concentrate is non-toxic, non-caustic and is absolutely safe to handle and store.  D.M. Concentrate is COMPLETELY <br>
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.<br>
<br>
9. Administration of the treatment is safe and simple. The testing procedure is positive and simple and is more easily and more quickly carried out by boiler room personnel.<br>
<br>
10. The action of D.M. Concentrate in scale prevention is physical or mechanical - not chemical, with the result that D.M. Concentrate may be used to prevent scale formation in any type of water.<br>
<br>
As the action of D.M. Concentrate on suspended Matter or dissolved solids as they come out of solution is mechanical, the D.M. Concentrate does not differentiate between silica and calcium sulphate for instance. It is equally efficient in protection against every kind of scale, from all types of water.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate has little effect on pH value. It is non-alkaline and about as acid as a &quot;good cup of tea&quot;.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be used in boiler pressures where the temperature and pressure are high enough to render sodium sulphite unsafe, as sodium sulphite will, at these temperatures and pressures, possibly form sulphuric or sulphurous acid.<br>
<br>
D.M. Concentrate can be, and should be, used after softening plants or any type of pre-treatment. The amount of D.M. Concentrate used will naturally be greatly lowered. The D.M. Concentrate reserve in the water is there when needed to treat any residual hardness or any residual oxygen that may come over due to any maloperation of the pre-treated plant or sudden increased demands above its designed flow rate.<br>

                            STEAM BOILERS AND GENERATORS WATER TREATMENT<br>
<br>
1- Corrosion Control and Scale Inhibitor<br>
<br>
Based on a blend of carefully selected tannins for use in steam raising boilers and generators. provides both corrosion protection, scale inhibition, oxygen scavenging , forming a protective film and disrupting the crystal growth. <br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate also prevents galvanic or electrolytic corrosion up to 2 volts and conditions the sludge.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT FOR STEAM SYSTEMS<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate is composed of several different organic tannins, both natural and synthetic. The formulation was carefully compounded to give the highest efficiency with all types of water in high, low and medium pressure boilers. It is also the ideal treatment for any residual hardness or residual oxygen, which may carry over from pre-treatment. The various components of THERMITAN Concentrate have been selected for their exceptional stability under all boiler conditions.<br>
<br>
All the various organic components act in oxygen absorption, in forming a light flocculent sludge instead of scale, and in changing the oxide surface of all underwater ferrous substances to tannen/ferric complex. Some are better than others as oxygen scavengers. Some are better than others in forming sludge. Some in keeping it finely divided and flocculent. However, all work together as a team to produce the finest results. In many cases, one or two act as catalysts on each other. Blended together giving better results than the same amount of one ingredient alone.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate immediately acts on all dissolved and free oxygen in water, and in a matter of seconds all oxygen is absorbed.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate does not act on dissolved solids. While they are in solution, they are harmless. However, as they come out of solution in the crystalline form and are in a position to form scale, the THERMITAN Concentrate as a colloidal suspension immediately coats the crystals as they start to form with a Monomolecular, non-adherent, colloidal &quot;sheen&quot; preventing crystalline growth and crystalline adherence by distorting the crystal shape, so that they cannot form scale, but only finely divided sludge which is removed with normal blow-down.<br>
<br>
The THERMITAN Concentrate also chemically reacts with the underwater oxide surface of the various boiler tubes, boiler walls, and the <br>
tube sheets forming an inert tannate/ferric &quot;sheen&quot;. This &quot;sheen&quot; gives absolutely no thermal insulation. However, by covering the anode of the iron and changing the oxide cathodes to an inert tannate, existing galvanic corrosion is sealed off and future galvanic corrosion prevented, both by anodic and cathodic protection up to 2 Volts D.C.<br>
<br>
The carefully calculated formulation of THERMITAN Concentrate and the interaction of its components render its action more effective <br>
than the action produced by any single tannin. <br>
<br>
Although THERMITAN Concentrate may appear to cost more per quart or gallon than other boiler treatments on the market, it must be <br>
remembered that THERMITAN is a CONCENTRATE. By manufacturing D.M. Concentrate ourselves, under our own control and supervision. <br>
<br>
The true test of the economy of a treatment is not the price per quart but how many thousand gallons of steam producing water that quart will treat. Also, how effectively it maintains the boiler in proper condition and eliminates continuous and costly down time and maintenance. The average dosage is up to 5 oz. per 1,000 gallons of make-up water.<br>
<br>
SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THERMITAN CONCENTRATE BOILER WATER TREATMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br>
<br>
1. THERMITAN Concentrate prevents hardness and other scale forming substances in solution or suspended matter entering the boiler <br>
with the feed water from adhering to the heated surfaces and a scale free boiler is maintained.<br>
<br>
2. Silica, by the action of THERMITAN Concentrate is prevented from complexing with iron, alumina and hardness salts to form <br>
silicate scales.<br>
<br>
3. Oxygen is absorbed in the boiler and pre-boiler parts of the system.<br>
<br>
4. Active corrosion is arrested and incidence of further corrosion is prevented by the formation of the tannate/ferric <br>
oxide on underwater surfaces.<br>
<br>
5. THERMITAN Concentrate reacts with any free iron in suspension to produce a tannate-iron oxide complex which counteracts its <br>
tendency to adhere to heated surfaces, particularly so when the surface has been changed by THERMITAN Concentrate to the tannate/ferric surface. This iron or iron oxide in suspension may have come from pick-up in the feed system or other systems external to the boiler.<br>
<br>
6. The addition of THERMITAN Concentrate forming a colloidal suspension does not appreciably increase the total dissolved solids of the boiler water necessitating a greatly increased blow down. Over dosing of THERMITAN Concentrate can do no harm as the THERMITAN Concentrate in the boiler water is a reserve for future need, and this is merely increasing the reserve.  <br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate will not carry over with steam.<br>
<br>
Conventional chemical treatments usually based on phosphate and soda themselves contribute substantially to the total dissolved <br>
solids of the boiler water materially increasing the necessary blow down. They often change the boiler&#39;s action into not only being a boiler, but having to be a softening plant as well. The amount of alkalinity necessary to do the softening job, sometimes increases the T.D.S. and the alkalinity to the point where foaming and priming are likely -especially when sudden changes in the boiler load take place. With THERMITAN., alkaline chemicals are only used to raise the pH to between 9.5 to 10 (this is below the T.D.S. and alkalinity limits, where priming or foaming is likely). They eliminate any possibility of acid corrosion and the THERMITAN Concentrate goes further and has greater oxygen absorption ability in alkaline waters. <br>
<br>
By using our conjunctional treatments with THERMITAN., the amount of THERMITAN Concentrate used is slightly lowered.<br>
<br>
7. THERMITAN Concentrate itself tends to inhibit caustic embrittlement. In any conjunctional treatment we supply for use with THERMITAN Concentrate in which there is caustic there is enough nitrate mixed with the caustic to insure that the caustic-<br>
nitrate ratio is above that needed to prevent caustic embrittlement.<br>
<br>
8. THERMITAN Concentrate is non-toxic, non-caustic and is absolutely safe to handle and store.  THERMITAN is COMPLETELY <br>
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.<br>
<br>
9. Administration of the treatment is safe and simple. The testing procedure is positive and simple and is more easily and <br>
more quickly carried out by boiler room personnel.<br>
<br>
10. The action of THERMITAN Concentrate in scale prevention is physical or mechanical - not chemical, with the result that D.M. <br>
Concentrate may be used to prevent scale formation in any type of water.<br>
<br>
As the action of THERMITAN Concentrate on suspended Matter or dissolved solids as they come out of solution is mechanical, the <br>
D.M. Concentrate does not differentiate between silica and calcium sulphate for instance. It is equally efficient in protection against every kind of scale, from all types of water.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate has little effect on pH value. It is non-alkaline and about as acid as a &quot;good cup of tea&quot;.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate can be used in boiler pressures where the temperature and pressure are high enough to render sodium <br>
sulphite unsafe, as sodium sulphite will, at these temperatures and pressures, possibly form sulphuric or sulphurous acid.<br>
<br>
THERMITAN Concentrate can be, and should be, used after softening plants or any type of pre-treatment. The amount of THERMITAN <br>
Concentrate used will naturally be greatly lowered. The THERMITAN. Concentrate reserve in the water is there when needed to treat <br>
any residual hardness or any residual oxygen that may come over due to any maloperation of the pre-treated plant or sudden <br>
increased demands above its designed flow rate.<br>
