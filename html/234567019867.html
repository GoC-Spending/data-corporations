        <br>            Protegra is passionate, creative professionals providing business and technology solutions around the world including Canada, the United States, Japan and Europe. Our clients include organizations in the financial services, agricultural, and healthcare industries. Protegra is founded and operates on the principle of partnership with its customers. We believe successful business solutions are based on a complete understanding of our customers businesses, solid technology delivery capability and clear communication.<br><br>Protegras offering combination of business process improvement, organizational effectiveness, strategic planning, software solution implementation and virtual IT sets us apart from the information technology industry and is embodied in Protegras mission: To add value to our clients businesses through the creation and evolution of software-enabled systems.<br><br>Protegras focus on lean processes is apparent in its Value Management System (VMS) and LifecycleTM methodologies. The Protegra VMS is the organizational quality management system governing the business processes of Protegra. The Protegra LifecycleTM is a lean and agile project methodology and quality system that supports Protegras solution delivery model. Lean software development principles mirror lean manufacturing by focusing on value, and attacking waste at its roots. This is achieved by implementing efficient iterative processes supported by high bandwidth team-client communication and rapid feedback mechanisms. Lean development principles and practices address the most common root causes of information technology project failures, particularly those that have plagued large enterprise projects. This is well documented in todays research and literature.<br><br>Protegras entire capability is built around the best professionals in the business.

                            The foundation of our approach is to work with the customer to map the value streams of your organization.  A value stream is a realistic end-to-end view of components (business process, desired outcomes, success measurements, stakeholders) that contribute to your organizations delivery of value. We facilitate a process to model the key value streams within your organization. Our concept is that your business or program focus - operations, people, processes, and outcomes  needs to be directly linked to a value stream. We will also help you identify the barriers today that are stopping you from achieving the delivery of more value. We believe that identifying your value streams is fundamental for evaluating impacts, risks and benefits, and costs of change to your business.<br>
<br>
We will then work with you to create a Unified Business Model. Our experience with this approach is that our customers are able to quickly view models of their organizations business processes and how they link with their value streams. They are able to understand what is key to driving value, and are able to evaluate necessary policy, process and organizational changes to increase the value that their organization is delivering. To support this process, we will collect and analyze your business performance data metrics that provides valuable input to assessing your business process contribution to value. The Unified Business Model becomes the to be model of your business. Our customers have found that this approach creates a business model framework which becomes an excellent tool for optimizing &amp; managing change within their organization.<br>
<br>
We believe that innovation and best practices of your leadership team in this process is critical to your success. Also key to your success is applying experiences from other industries, government agencies, and related sectors. Protegra has best practice expertise from several sectors, including financial services, health care and government. We will facilitate planning around the best to be processes.<br>
<br>
The Protegra team understands business and technology realities. Every organization whether private or public wants to do the absolute best, but constraints are usually present that force tough decisions.  You will find that Protegra helps you consider those constraints in the context of your value stream outcomes  we help you optimize your conceptual solution and your to be business processes for future implementation. The benefit is that you will end up with requirements  policy, process, functional and non-functional requirements that are based on reality. This is a solid benefit of our approach. <br>
<br>
We help you develop these two key deliverables:<br>
<br>
Value Stream Analysis  through workshop and analysis activities, create models for review by senior stakeholders to:<br>
	Identify desired business outcomes and stakeholders the organization delivers value to<br>
	Define performance model for the organization detailing value streams <br>
	Document business processes and flow supporting the value streams<br>
	Document and analyze business systems supporting business processes<br>
	Collect performance metrics for business processes; current service levels<br>
	Analysis and document performance gap (How Often and How Well)<br>
	Identify factors affecting performance (Barriers and Enhancers)<br>
	Identify current service levels  performance metrics - within the organization<br>
<br>
Unified Business Model  through workshops and analysis activities, create a framework to:<br>
	Establish an enterprise understanding of current state<br>
	Create policy, process, organization, or automation options that can address future state<br>
	Define measures of success and objectives (future service levels and other desired performance metrics)<br>
	Document to be business processes and flows; <br>
	Identify level of criticality to the business processes, to assist with next phase of your project<br>
	Identify key focus areas for improvement<br>

                            Traditional systems architectures have been based on how an organization or department functions, which creates and systemizes compartmentalized or silo thinking versus services-oriented or client-oriented thinking.  Service-oriented architecture takes a more holistic view, provisioned by loosely coupled service components.  The main resulting benefit allows organizations to adjust and create discrete service components as they evolve without requiring extensive re-writes.<br>
<br>
Whether we are assisting a customer solve a single business problem, or helping them with a strategic new business venture, we base our architecture and IT strategy recommendations on enterprise component reuse, return on investment, organizational readiness, and efficient and effective business processes where it makes sense. Before we automate, we help the customer optimize and maximize business returns for their investments.<br>
<br>
One of Protegras key differentiators is the caliber of our senior architects. These professionals have a depth and breadth of business domain and technology experience. They lead teams, utilize and develop best practices, mentor team members, and act as trusted advisor to our customers for technology related issues. To the extent that our customers require, these architects can act in leadership roles within our customers organization.  <br>

Our IT Architecture methods have a service-based focus. We have developed a best practices pragmatic approach to research and evaluation of architecture options. Our senior architects understand both traditional and emerging technical patterns and practices, can leverage existing technologies where it makes sense, assess risk and offer mitigation strategies, analyze costs and benefits, and define and assess impact on the organization.   <br>
<br>
IT Strategic Planning<br>
<br>
Protegras guiding principle is linking IT initiatives to business strategies, with well-defined outcomes that can be measured in business terms. <br>
<br>
We not only help our customers define the technology, systems, and information strategies for the organization, we facilitate determining the organizational readiness to achieve their desired state.  For example, a customer may have an objective of business transformation, with IT enablement playing a key role in that transformation.  Our teams help them with governance models, skills and competencies gap analysis and strategies for both business and IT personnel. We can also assist in process implementation for effective IT delivery management and architecture management.   A key part of our methodology is building communication strategies with a purpose of achieving business buy-in and understanding.  Our guiding principle is that an effective partnership with the business is a mandatory requirement for a mature and effective IT function.<br>
<br>
Our IT Strategic Planning process is also pragmatic in that we get value and results as early as possible for our customer. We identify and implement key IT investments and quick wins, where possible, in frameworks, solutions, and package implementations that meet the strategic needs of the organization. Protegras processes and organization are set up around our Value Management System (see Section 4 for more details), which engrains effective measurement through monitoring and governance.<br>

Protegras research and development activities have produced re-usable software frameworks.  These frameworks reduce time to completion because re-usable software frameworks coupled with custom development provide a quick 100% fit.  The use of flexible frameworks also means that business processes do not need to bend to fit packaged software.<br>
<br>
These frameworks may be licensed, if appropriate, as part of a systems initiative with a customer. Using either .NET or Open Source:<br>
-	Business Component Framework (BCF) - Helps standardize your enterprise application design in an SOA-compliant manner<br>
-	Extract Transform Load Framework (ETL) - Provides a pre-defined architecture and code patterns for data integration initiatives<br>
-	Resource Manager - Enables the user to configure applications overall look and feel including private branding and multi-lingual support<br>
-	Security Framework - Provides application and data-level security<br>
-	WebShell and WebControls - Delivers highly functional, aesthetically appealing user interfaces<br>

Lean Solution Development<br>
<br>
Having the right people who truly work as a team makes anything possible. Protegras core values attract passionate, creative professionals who want to be empowered to deliver value and innovation to clients. The same principle of empowerment is a key element of lean development. Every project team member understands the business vision and solution concept that must be deployed to achieve the expected business outcomes. Every team member is empowered to make design decisions supported by their technical savvy, high bandwidth communication with users and solid quality assurance practices.  <br>
<br>
Lean solution development principles mirror lean manufacturing by focusing on value, and attacking waste at its roots. This is achieved by implementing efficient iterative processes supported by high bandwidth team-client communication and rapid feedback mechanisms. Lean development principles and practices address the most common root causes of information technology project failures, well documented in todays research and literature.<br>
<br>
Protegra believes that to compete globally, it must be lean, empowered and innovative. According to Protegra CEO, Wadood Ibrahim, In the software industry, off-shore development uses a traditional waterfall approach that we now understand has fundamental flaws. This method requires wasteful up-front investments to develop detailed specifications to allow anyone, anywhere, to develop the code. This seldom produces a working system before the business requirements have changed in response to competitive pressures (i.e. business requirements which necessitated the system in the first place). <br>
<br>
In the end, businesses that follow this traditional approach will lose the race to competitors who can rapidly respond to global pressures. There is far more value in a lean approach where business stakeholders work very closely with the development team. It is clear that the whole off-shore software development trend erodes the local information technology sector and its workforce. Our experience with Parks Reservation System is evidence that we can do much more than compete.<br>

Application Maintenance Services<br>
<br>
Protegra offers a comprehensive solution maintenance program for any solution that it develops. These maintenance programs are tailored to the specific requirements of a particular client organization. <br>
<br>
Protegra will also enter into maintenance options that provide for the full evolution of a system through its lifecycle. These relationships have been developed to support legacy applications that were originally developed by the client or other third party. <br>
<br>
Protegra also currently provides 24x7 on-call support services for a number of its clients.<br>

                            The foundation of our approach is to work with the customer to map the value streams of your organization.  A value stream is a realistic end-to-end view of components (business process, desired outcomes, success measurements, stakeholders) that contribute to your organizations delivery of value. We facilitate a process to model the key value streams within your organization. Our concept is that your business or program focus - operations, people, processes, and outcomes  needs to be directly linked to a value stream. We will also help you identify the barriers today that are stopping you from achieving the delivery of more value. We believe that identifying your value streams is fundamental for evaluating impacts, risks and benefits, and costs of change to your business.<br>
<br>
We will then work with you to create a Unified Business Model. Our experience with this approach is that our customers are able to quickly view models of their organizations business processes and how they link with their value streams. They are able to understand what is key to driving value, and are able to evaluate necessary policy, process and organizational changes to increase the value that their organization is delivering. To support this process, we will collect and analyze your business performance data metrics that provides valuable input to assessing your business process contribution to value. The Unified Business Model becomes the to be model of your business. Our customers have found that this approach creates a business model framework which becomes an excellent tool for optimizing &amp; managing change within their organization.<br>
<br>
We believe that innovation and best practices of your leadership team in this process is critical to your success. Also key to your success is applying experiences from other industries, government agencies, and related sectors. Protegra has best practice expertise from several sectors, including financial services, health care and government. We will facilitate planning around the best to be processes.<br>
<br>
The Protegra team understands business and technology realities. Every organization whether private or public wants to do the absolute best, but constraints are usually present that force tough decisions.  You will find that Protegra helps you consider those constraints in the context of your value stream outcomes  we help you optimize your conceptual solution and your to be business processes for future implementation. The benefit is that you will end up with requirements  policy, process, functional and non-functional requirements that are based on reality. This is a solid benefit of our approach. <br>
<br>
We help you develop these two key deliverables:<br>
<br>
Value Stream Analysis  through workshop and analysis activities, create models for review by senior stakeholders to:<br>
	Identify desired business outcomes and stakeholders the organization delivers value to<br>
	Define performance model for the organization detailing value streams <br>
	Document business processes and flow supporting the value streams<br>
	Document and analyze business systems supporting business processes<br>
	Collect performance metrics for business processes; current service levels<br>
	Analysis and document performance gap (How Often and How Well)<br>
	Identify factors affecting performance (Barriers and Enhancers)<br>
	Identify current service levels  performance metrics - within the organization<br>
<br>
Unified Business Model  through workshops and analysis activities, create a framework to:<br>
	Establish an enterprise understanding of current state<br>
	Create policy, process, organization, or automation options that can address future state<br>
	Define measures of success and objectives (future service levels and other desired performance metrics)<br>
	Document to be business processes and flows; <br>
	Identify level of criticality to the business processes, to assist with next phase of your project<br>
	Identify key focus areas for improvement<br>

                            Traditional systems architectures have been based on how an organization or department functions, which creates and systemizes compartmentalized or silo thinking versus services-oriented or client-oriented thinking.  Service-oriented architecture takes a more holistic view, provisioned by loosely coupled service components.  The main resulting benefit allows organizations to adjust and create discrete service components as they evolve without requiring extensive re-writes.<br>
<br>
Whether we are assisting a customer solve a single business problem, or helping them with a strategic new business venture, we base our architecture and IT strategy recommendations on enterprise component reuse, return on investment, organizational readiness, and efficient and effective business processes where it makes sense. Before we automate, we help the customer optimize and maximize business returns for their investments.<br>
<br>
One of Protegras key differentiators is the caliber of our senior architects. These professionals have a depth and breadth of business domain and technology experience. They lead teams, utilize and develop best practices, mentor team members, and act as trusted advisor to our customers for technology related issues. To the extent that our customers require, these architects can act in leadership roles within our customers organization.  <br>
<br>
Our IT Architecture methods have a service-based focus. We have developed a best practices pragmatic approach to research and evaluation of architecture options. Our senior architects understand both traditional and emerging technical patterns and practices, can leverage existing technologies where it makes sense, assess risk and offer mitigation strategies, analyze costs and benefits, and define and assess impact on the organization.   <br>
<br>
IT Strategic Planning<br>
<br>
Protegras guiding principle is linking IT initiatives to business strategies, with well-defined outcomes that can be measured in business terms. <br>
<br>
We not only help our customers define the technology, systems, and information strategies for the organization, we facilitate determining the organizational readiness to achieve their desired state.  For example, a customer may have an objective of business transformation, with IT enablement playing a key role in that transformation.  Our teams help them with governance models, skills and competencies gap analysis and strategies for both business and IT personnel. We can also assist in process implementation for effective IT delivery management and architecture management.   A key part of our methodology is building communication strategies with a purpose of achieving business buy-in and understanding.  Our guiding principle is that an effective partnership with the business is a mandatory requirement for a mature and effective IT function.<br>
<br>
Our IT Strategic Planning process is also pragmatic in that we get value and results as early as possible for our customer. We identify and implement key IT investments and quick wins, where possible, in frameworks, solutions, and package implementations that meet the strategic needs of the organization. Protegras processes and organization are set up around our Value Management System (see Section 4 for more details), which engrains effective measurement through monitoring and governance.<br>

Protegras research and development activities have produced re-usable software frameworks.  These frameworks reduce time to completion because re-usable software frameworks coupled with custom development provide a quick 100% fit.  The use of flexible frameworks also means that business processes do not need to bend to fit packaged software.<br>
<br>
These frameworks may be licensed, if appropriate, as part of a systems initiative with a customer. Using either .NET or Open Source:<br>
-	Business Component Framework (BCF) - Helps standardize your enterprise application design in an SOA-compliant manner<br>
-	Extract Transform Load Framework (ETL) - Provides a pre-defined architecture and code patterns for data integration initiatives<br>
-	Resource Manager - Enables the user to configure applications overall look and feel including private branding and multi-lingual support<br>
-	Security Framework - Provides application and data-level security<br>
-	WebShell and WebControls - Delivers highly functional, aesthetically appealing user interfaces<br>

Lean Solution Development<br>
<br>
Having the right people who truly work as a team makes anything possible. Protegras core values attract passionate, creative professionals who want to be empowered to deliver value and innovation to clients. The same principle of empowerment is a key element of lean development. Every project team member understands the business vision and solution concept that must be deployed to achieve the expected business outcomes. Every team member is empowered to make design decisions supported by their technical savvy, high bandwidth communication with users and solid quality assurance practices.  <br>
<br>
Lean solution development principles mirror lean manufacturing by focusing on value, and attacking waste at its roots. This is achieved by implementing efficient iterative processes supported by high bandwidth team-client communication and rapid feedback mechanisms. Lean development principles and practices address the most common root causes of information technology project failures, well documented in todays research and literature.<br>
<br>
Protegra believes that to compete globally, it must be lean, empowered and innovative. According to Protegra CEO, Wadood Ibrahim, In the software industry, off-shore development uses a traditional waterfall approach that we now understand has fundamental flaws. This method requires wasteful up-front investments to develop detailed specifications to allow anyone, anywhere, to develop the code. This seldom produces a working system before the business requirements have changed in response to competitive pressures (i.e. business requirements which necessitated the system in the first place). <br>
<br>
In the end, businesses that follow this traditional approach will lose the race to competitors who can rapidly respond to global pressures. There is far more value in a lean approach where business stakeholders work very closely with the development team. It is clear that the whole off-shore software development trend erodes the local information technology sector and its workforce. Our experience with Parks Reservation System is evidence that we can do much more than compete.<br>

Application Maintenance Services<br>
<br>
Protegra offers a comprehensive solution maintenance program for any solution that it develops. These maintenance programs are tailored to the specific requirements of a particular client organization. <br>
<br>
Protegra will also enter into maintenance options that provide for the full evolution of a system through its lifecycle. These relationships have been developed to support legacy applications that were originally developed by the client or other third party. <br>
<br>
Protegra also currently provides 24x7 on-call support services for a number of its clients.<br>
