                            Pipelines are a common means to transport a fluid from one point to another.  Whether water or slurry, above ground or below ground, we have experienced pipeline and specialized discipline engineers who can make the necessary layouts, configure the flow control equipment and operators, and prepare detailed designs, provide construction quality and engineering support, and commissioning services.  Our experience includes steel, concrete, HDPE, fiberglass, plastic, wood and other pipeline materials. We routinely perform steady state and water hammer analyses, and perform more sophisticated CFD and other dynamic simulations when required.   Our mechanical and geotechnical analyses techniques allow our design team to reduce expensive anchor and thrust blocks, to provide our clients with competitive cost results.<br>
<br>
Most water projects, energy projects and often mining projects have a requirement for pumps, pumping systems and pump stations.  We use the latest engineering techniques to optimize and size pumps and pump motors.  Our expertise includes all type of pumps from small capacity to large capacity, from simple well pumps to a large pumped storage pumped turbine unit.  We have experience in all ranges of flows and heads and in all climate conditions.  Our life cycle and energy efficiency efforts include pump selection, high efficiency motor selection, energy and capacity analyses, variable speed consideration, and other aspects which can reduce both operation costs and wasted energy.  <br>
<br>
Our experience in mine slurry and water pipelines and pumpstations ranges from design, specification and construction supervision, including test monitoring, followed by operational assistance and performance monitoring.  By tailoring pump and pipeline selection to a range of flows, pressures and material conditions anticipated over the project life, we provide cost-effective and environmentally sound slurry and water handling. Our extensive experience in the management and handling of slurry streams includes tailings, concentrates and cycloned sands. <br>

                            We have designed and assisted with managing a large number of water management systems for mining projects around the world. In most cases, these are site wide, fully integrated systems that involve a thorough understanding of the site-specific hydrometeorology, surface water (hydrology) and groundwater (hydrogeology), waste characterization, environmental and permit limitations and client preferred operational philosophies.  Probabilistic modeling is commonly adopted to confirm that all extreme scenarios are identified and addressed in order to meet sustainability objectives.<br>

                            We seek to eliminate wasted energy usage by identifying root factors that consume the most energy and reduce overall system efficiency. Through systems engineering approaches, we target costly equipment, systems and control loops, and plan for the future to effectively transform operations into a leaner, more productive and effective business. We prioritize energy and capacity usage through initial and ongoing systems reviews and audits using improved energy and demand-side management. <br>

                            Cold regions provide unique engineering challenges for mine developers. Many mines are in remote locations, where overland access can be difficult and dangerous.  Vast distances place severe limitations on the costs of bringing labour, equipment and supplies to site, and on the cost of transporting the products to market.  Knight Piésold has a proven track record in designing sound and cost-effective engineering solutions for mines in areas as difficult and remote as Canada&#39;s North, Alaska and other cold regions throughout the world.<br>
<br>
Harsh environments impose unique constraints on the engineering design of projects in cold regions. Climatic concerns include extreme cold, wind chill, icing, reduced visibility due to blowing snow and radiation fogs.  Geotechnical concerns may include permafrost, solifluction and frost-heaving, saturated soils and a lack of granular materials.  Water may be in short supply, as the annual precipitation is usually low and surface water sources are frozen for most of the year. Mine facilities, including tailings disposal systems, water storage dams, waste rock repositories, decant systems and heap leach systems, must all be designed to operate in these extreme winter conditions.<br>
<br>
Knight Piésold has gained significant experience in cold regions engineering from the involvement in mining projects in Northern Canada and the U.S. In addition, Knight Piésold has extensive experience working for mines in colder climates at high altitudes in the mountainous regions around the world.<br>
<br>
Knight Piésolds experience includes:<br>
<br>
	Site investigation programs to investigate general soil, bedrock and permafrost conditions associated with infrastructure.<br>
 Winter drilling, including locating and investigating water sources for drilling, and measures taken to preserve frozen core samples.<br>
 Pipeline and pump designs - completed considering extreme cold temperatures and potential effects on pipeline and pump materials and performance and operation.<br>
	Design and construction of infrastructure considering extreme cold temperatures, in particular, scheduling and timing of certain components of the construction and what materials to use.<br>
 Tailings management in extreme cold conditions.<br>
 Water storage ponds designed and constructed in freezing conditions using free draining sand and synthetic liners.<br>

                            Pipelines are a common means to transport a fluid from one point to another.  Whether water or slurry, above ground or below ground, we have experienced pipeline and specialized discipline engineers who can make the necessary layouts, configure the flow control equipment and operators, and prepare detailed designs, provide construction quality and engineering support, and commissioning services.  Our experience includes steel, concrete, HDPE, fiberglass, plastic, wood and other pipeline materials. We routinely perform steady state and water hammer analyses, and perform more sophisticated CFD and other dynamic simulations when required.   Our mechanical and geotechnical analyses techniques allow our design team to reduce expensive anchor and thrust blocks, to provide our clients with competitive cost results.<br>
<br>
Most water projects, energy projects and often mining projects have a requirement for pumps, pumping systems and pump stations.  We use the latest engineering techniques to optimize and size pumps and pump motors.  Our expertise includes all type of pumps from small capacity to large capacity, from simple well pumps to a large pumped storage pumped turbine unit.  We have experience in all ranges of flows and heads and in all climate conditions.  Our life cycle and energy efficiency efforts include pump selection, high efficiency motor selection, energy and capacity analyses, variable speed consideration, and other aspects which can reduce both operation costs and wasted energy.  <br>
<br>
Our experience in mine slurry and water pipelines and pumpstations ranges from design, specification and construction supervision, including test monitoring, followed by operational assistance and performance monitoring.  By tailoring pump and pipeline selection to a range of flows, pressures and material conditions anticipated over the project life, we provide cost-effective and environmentally sound slurry and water handling. Our extensive experience in the management and handling of slurry streams includes tailings, concentrates and cycloned sands. <br>

                            Through sound rock engineering principles, we implement advanced, cost-effective investigation and analytical methods to evaluate the geomechanical characteristics of various complex geological and mining conditions. We design and manage site investigation programs, develop pit slope designs, conduct stability assessments and operational monitoring for active open pit slopes, and evaluate stabilization/support systems for underground mines. Micro-seismic monitoring of underground mines is one of our specialties.<br>

                            We have designed and assisted with managing a large number of water management systems for mining projects around the world. In most cases, these are site wide, fully integrated systems that involve a thorough understanding of the site-specific hydrometeorology, surface water (hydrology) and groundwater (hydrogeology), waste characterization, environmental and permit limitations and client preferred operational philosophies.  Probabilistic modeling is commonly adopted to confirm that all extreme scenarios are identified and addressed in order to meet sustainability objectives.<br>

                            We seek to eliminate wasted energy usage by identifying root factors that consume the most energy and reduce overall system efficiency. Through systems engineering approaches, we target costly equipment, systems and control loops, and plan for the future to effectively transform operations into a leaner, more productive and effective business. We prioritize energy and capacity usage through initial and ongoing systems reviews and audits using improved energy and demand-side management. <br>

                            Cold regions provide unique engineering challenges for mine developers. Many mines are in remote locations, where overland access can be difficult and dangerous.  Vast distances place severe limitations on the costs of bringing labour, equipment and supplies to site, and on the cost of transporting the products to market.  Knight Piésold has a proven track record in designing sound and cost-effective engineering solutions for mines in areas as difficult and remote as Canada&#39;s North, Alaska and other cold regions throughout the world.<br>
<br>
Harsh environments impose unique constraints on the engineering design of projects in cold regions. Climatic concerns include extreme cold, wind chill, icing, reduced visibility due to blowing snow and radiation fogs.  Geotechnical concerns may include permafrost, solifluction and frost-heaving, saturated soils and a lack of granular materials.  Water may be in short supply, as the annual precipitation is usually low and surface water sources are frozen for most of the year. Mine facilities, including tailings disposal systems, water storage dams, waste rock repositories, decant systems and heap leach systems, must all be designed to operate in these extreme winter conditions.<br>
<br>
Knight Piésold has gained significant experience in cold regions engineering from the involvement in mining projects in Northern Canada and the U.S. In addition, Knight Piésold has extensive experience working for mines in colder climates at high altitudes in the mountainous regions around the world.<br>
<br>
Knight Piésolds experience includes:<br>
<br>
	Site investigation programs to investigate general soil, bedrock and permafrost conditions associated with infrastructure.<br>
 Winter drilling, including locating and investigating water sources for drilling, and measures taken to preserve frozen core samples.<br>
 Pipeline and pump designs - completed considering extreme cold temperatures and potential effects on pipeline and pump materials and performance and operation.<br>
	Design and construction of infrastructure considering extreme cold temperatures, in particular, scheduling and timing of certain components of the construction and what materials to use.<br>
 Tailings management in extreme cold conditions.<br>
 Water storage ponds designed and constructed in freezing conditions using free draining sand and synthetic liners.<br>
