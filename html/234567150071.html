Here&#39;s what clients have to say:<br>
<br>
I am getting at least 15% more work done every day using Sherrys systems. My electronic and physical file systems are now so well-organized that I no longer fear losing or missing an important file or deadline. I appreciated that Sherry took the time to ensure that I understood exactly how to use the materials she provided. And the regular teleconferences kept me focused on achieving one or two small goals each week. I was so inspired by Sherrys programs that I even cleared out my office  its now a welcoming and aesthetically pleasing environment. I would love to carry over the lessons I learned from the Calm Your Office Chaos program into my home life! Maureen Curtin, Department of English, Simon Fraser University<br>

People love Paper Tiger<br>
<br>
Paper flow, file management was a mess before we purchased and started using Paper Tiger. Everyone had their own way of filing.  Once the initial set up was complete we were truly able to find any piece of paper within 5 seconds. It has been a great time saver. We have managed to avoid paper duplication. Many staff have been trained on the Paper Tiger software, so when staff are away documents can be found with ease. We have definitely saved time in our workday because we are better organized. I would say we have gained an extra 2-3 hours per day now that we have an electronic filing system that is very user friendly. Kevin Wilson, Office Manager, Hailikaas Heiltsuk Health Centre<br>

<br>
I am getting at least 15% more work done every day using Sherrys systems. My electronic and physical file systems are now so well-organized that I no longer fear losing or missing an important file or deadline. I appreciated that Sherry took the time to ensure that I understood exactly how to use the materials she provided. And the regular teleconferences kept me focused on achieving one or two small goals each week. I was so inspired by Sherrys programs that I even cleared out my office  its now a welcoming and aesthetically pleasing environment. I would love to carry over the lessons I learned from the Calm Your Office Chaos program into my home life! Maureen Curtin, Department of English, Simon Fraser University<br>

People love Paper Tiger<br>
<br>
Paper flow, file management was a mess before we purchased and started using Paper Tiger. Everyone had their own way of filing.  Once the initial set up was complete we were truly able to find any piece of paper within 5 seconds. It has been a great time saver. We have managed to avoid paper duplication. Many staff have been trained on the Paper Tiger software, so when staff are away documents can be found with ease. We have definitely saved time in our workday because we are better organized. I would say we have gained an extra 2-3 hours per day now that we have an electronic filing system that is very user friendly. Kevin Wilson, Office Manager, Hailikaas Heiltsuk Health Centre<br>
