                            Aquatic inventories and baseline environmental studies record the present quality of the environment within a particular area. This data is used to understand the current state of the environment and assist in the environmental assessment process to predict and quantify potential impacts to the environment.<br>
<br>
This information is often necessary for environmental assessment and permitting applications to allow an understanding of the current environment and what potential impacts your project may have. This helps to better understand how sustainable solutions can be developed for your project.<br>

                            An Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities on a property, and typically addresses both the underlying land as well as physical structures and improvements to the property. It is conducted in a phased approach:<br>
<br>
 -   Phase I ESA - a review of historical reports and records, interviews, a site reconnaissance, and other research to identify potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. The assessment includes the existing condition of the land as well as its historical use.<br>
 -   Phase II ESA - undertaken when an environmentally contaminating activities are discovered through the Phase I environmental site assessment and will describe the presence/absence and extent of contamination. In addition to reviewing the information from the Phase I ESA, it includes an intrusive sub-surface investigation of the soils and groundwater.<br>
 -   Phase III ESA - a delineation study which describes the depth or spread of a contamination plume. During this phase, further delineation of the horizontal and vertical depth of contamination will be undertaken, through further testing, sampling, and monitoring of the soil and groundwater. This phase will evaluate remediation methods as well as their feasibility and costs.  <br>
<br>
All phases conform to Canadian Standards Association (CSA) standards, provincial regulations (e.g. O. Reg. 153 as amended), as well as federal Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) methodologies. <br>

It is required for effective stewardship of natural resources and ensures that specific activities undertaken have regard for the environment, and other stakeholders. These can include:<br>
<br>
    Fisheries Act Authorizations<br>
    Species at Risk Act Permits<br>
    Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act – Location and Plans and Specification Approvals<br>
    Public Lands Act Work Permits<br>
    Environmental Protection Act – Environmental Compliance Approval<br>
    Ontario Water Resources Act – Permit to take Water<br>
    Conservation Authority Permits<br>
<br>
In many cases, these permits require that the impacts of the project on the surrounding environment be identified and assessed prior to a decision being made. This is called an Environmental Assessment, and is valuable in planning the project prior to undertaking any actions to ensure that long-term negative impacts are avoided. It will consider mitigation measures to offset negative impacts and will assess the impact of implementing these measures on the environment.<br>
<br>

                            An Environmental Impact Study typically involves an assessment of existing conditions of a particular component of the environment and to determine what the impact from a development project. It can involve liaising between clients and various agencies, and developing recommendations for mitigation, management and monitoring.<br>
<br>
An environmental impact study may be required for projects to determine what impacts may result and how best the risks could be managed. They are generally required by decision makers, including regulatory agencies and developers, to determine whether the project should proceed.<br>
<br>
For larger projects, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) may be required. An EIS is a summary of the environmental baseline conditions, an assessment of all the environmental impacts, and includes mitigation, monitoring and long-term management of the potential environmental impacts.<br>
<br>
Moggy Environmental can prepare environmental impact studies for projects at various scales in response to municipal, provincial, territorial and/or federal regulations and policies. Projects have included studies related to proposed mineral development, oil and gas, aggregate extraction operations, municipal infrastructure, and various land developments. We work closely with our team to integrate expertise from other disciplines, such as hydrogeology, hydrology, etc.<br>
Our services include:<br>
<br>
  -  Environmental impact studies in response to municipal, provincial, territorial and federal planning requirements;<br>
  -  Integrated studies to address multi-disciplinary issues;<br>
  -  Impact studies to address Fisheries Act requirements, including fish habitat assessments, offsetting/compensation plans; and,<br>
  -  Aquatic Habitat Assessments, including Water Quality and Lake Capacity Modeling and other limnological studies.<br>

                            Environmental Management and Monitoring Plans are necessary to ensure that the proposed measures identified as part of mitigating environmental impacts of a project are effectively implemented. They should identify feasible and cost effective measures that reduce potentially significant adverse environmental impacts to acceptable levels.<br>
<br>
Regulatory agencies will often require mitigation, management and monitoring plans be prepared prior to issuing permits, and the conditions of the permits will require that these measures and plans be implemented effectively.<br>
<br>
Moggy Environmental can design, undertake and analyze management and monitoring programs for aquatic ecosystems, including water quality. We have developed and implemented monitoring programs in urban, rural and industrial settings across Ontario and the Arctic, and have advised clients on approaches, protocols, and appropriate designs for long-term monitoring.<br>

                            Peer review is the evaluation of work by an expert in the same field to make sure it maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility. It constitutes a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study.<br>
<br>
Developers often prepare environmental impact studies for resource projects. These studies are reviewed by government agencies and may be circulated for comment to a number of stakeholders, including non-profit organizations, First Nations and third-party reviewers.<br>
<br>
With 13 years of experience working for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Moggy Environmental provides expert advice on staying in compliance with environmental legislation related to the aquatic environment. We also provide peer review service of environmental assessment and impact statements reports, fisheries and aquatic baseline studies, mitigationand management plans and monitoring plan. This can be extended toprovide support and testimony for hearings at Environmental Assessment Boards and other resource management boards. We provide this support on behalf of private sector clients, as well as the federal, provincial and territorial governments, and municipalities.<br>

                            The development and maintenance of effective relationships with local communities and First Nations is critical for the success of any resource projects. Although there is a legal duty to consult with Aboriginal communities, which has greatly influenced that way resource development decisions are made with respect to industry, governments and affected communities, there continues to be many other important reasons to have an effective working relationships among all parties. This includes good governance, the development of mutually beneficial relationships, and gaining knowledge of the area and its resources.<br>
<br>
Many regulatory permits require that public and Aboriginal consultation be completed prior to issuance. Consultation requires effective engagement with the public and First Nations so that effective solutions can be developed.<br>

                            An Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities on a property, and typically addresses both the underlying land as well as physical structures and improvements to the property. It is conducted in a phased approach:<br>
<br>
 -   Phase I ESA - a review of historical reports and records, interviews, a site reconnaissance, and other research to identify potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. The assessment includes the existing condition of the land as well as its historical use.<br>
 -   Phase II ESA - undertaken when an environmentally contaminating activities are discovered through the Phase I environmental site assessment and will describe the presence/absence and extent of contamination. In addition to reviewing the information from the Phase I ESA, it includes an intrusive sub-surface investigation of the soils and groundwater.<br>
 -   Phase III ESA - a delineation study which describes the depth or spread of a contamination plume. During this phase, further delineation of the horizontal and vertical depth of contamination will be undertaken, through further testing, sampling, and monitoring of the soil and groundwater. This phase will evaluate remediation methods as well as their feasibility and costs.  <br>
<br>
All phases conform to Canadian Standards Association (CSA) standards, provincial regulations (e.g. O. Reg. 153 as amended), as well as federal Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) methodologies. <br>

                            Environmental regulatory permits are documents that are issued by a government agency under environmental legislation, which allows you to carry out an activity for a specified period of time. It is required for effective stewardship of natural resources and ensures that specific activities undertaken have regard for the environment, and other stakeholders. These can include:<br>
<br>
    Fisheries Act Authorizations<br>
    Species at Risk Act Permits<br>
    Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act – Location and Plans and Specification Approvals<br>
    Public Lands Act Work Permits<br>
    Environmental Protection Act – Environmental Compliance Approval<br>
    Ontario Water Resources Act – Permit to take Water<br>
    Conservation Authority Permits<br>
<br>
In many cases, these permits require that the impacts of the project on the surrounding environment be identified and assessed prior to a decision being made. This is called an Environmental Assessment, and is valuable in planning the project prior to undertaking any actions to ensure that long-term negative impacts are avoided. It will consider mitigation measures to offset negative impacts and will assess the impact of implementing these measures on the environment.<br>

                            An Environmental Impact Study typically involves an assessment of existing conditions of a particular component of the environment and to determine what the impact from a development project. It can involve liaising between clients and various agencies, and developing recommendations for mitigation, management and monitoring.<br>
<br>
An environmental impact study may be required for projects to determine what impacts may result and how best the risks could be managed. They are generally required by decision makers, including regulatory agencies and developers, to determine whether the project should proceed.<br>
<br>
For larger projects, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) may be required. An EIS is a summary of the environmental baseline conditions, an assessment of all the environmental impacts, and includes mitigation, monitoring and long-term management of the potential environmental impacts.<br>
<br>
Moggy Environmental can prepare environmental impact studies for projects at various scales in response to municipal, provincial, territorial and/or federal regulations and policies. Projects have included studies related to proposed mineral development, oil and gas, aggregate extraction operations, municipal infrastructure, and various land developments. We work closely with our team to integrate expertise from other disciplines, such as hydrogeology, hydrology, etc.<br>
Our services include:<br>
<br>
  -  Environmental impact studies in response to municipal, provincial, territorial and federal planning requirements;<br>
  -  Integrated studies to address multi-disciplinary issues;<br>
  -  Impact studies to address Fisheries Act requirements, including fish habitat assessments, offsetting/compensation plans; and,<br>
  -  Aquatic Habitat Assessments, including Water Quality and Lake Capacity Modeling and other limnological studies.<br>

                            Environmental Management and Monitoring Plans are necessary to ensure that the proposed measures identified as part of mitigating environmental impacts of a project are effectively implemented. They should identify feasible and cost effective measures that reduce potentially significant adverse environmental impacts to acceptable levels.<br>
<br>
Regulatory agencies will often require mitigation, management and monitoring plans be prepared prior to issuing permits, and the conditions of the permits will require that these measures and plans be implemented effectively.<br>
<br>
Moggy Environmental can design, undertake and analyze management and monitoring programs for aquatic ecosystems, including water quality. We have developed and implemented monitoring programs in urban, rural and industrial settings across Ontario and the Arctic, and have advised clients on approaches, protocols, and appropriate designs for long-term monitoring.<br>

<br>
    Sediment and erosion control plans; and,<br>
    Fisheries mitigation and/or habitat compensation/offsetting plans;<br>
    Fish salvage plans;<br>
    Aquatic habitat restoration;<br>
    Permits-To-Take-Water;<br>

                            Project Management is the process and activity of planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources, procedures and protocols to achieve specific goals in scientific projects. This can include monitoring to ensure that goals are achieved, through project and site supervision.<br>
<br>
Regulatory permits and projects can have a number of components which need to be managed during the process to ensure timelines and budgets are met. This includes that site supervision is carried to ensure the permit conditions are implemented and are effective in achieving their outcomes.<br>
<br>
Moggy Environmental has experience in managing numerous environmental projects, from small to large, from simple to complex. We provide project management and site supervision to ensure that specific requirements related to the short and long-term protection of the environment are implemented as specified, and that compensation or mitigation activities are implemented as planned. We are trained and experienced in ensuring that mitigation measures are implemented as designed to ensure your project minimizes impacts on the environment.<br>

                            Peer review is the evaluation of work by an expert in the same field to make sure it maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility. It constitutes a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study.<br>
<br>
Developers often prepare environmental impact studies for resource projects. These studies are reviewed by government agencies and may be circulated for comment to a number of stakeholders, including non-profit organizations, First Nations and third-party reviewers.<br>
<br>
With 13 years of experience working for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), Moggy Environmental provides expert advice on staying in compliance with environmental legislation related to the aquatic environment. We also provide peer review service of environmental assessment and impact statements reports, fisheries and aquatic baseline studies, mitigationand management plans and monitoring plan. This can be extended toprovide support and testimony for hearings at Environmental Assessment Boards and other resource management boards. We provide this support on behalf of private sector clients, as well as the federal, provincial and territorial governments, and municipalities.<br>

                            The development and maintenance of effective relationships with local communities and First Nations is critical for the success of any resource projects. Although there is a legal duty to consult with Aboriginal communities, which has greatly influenced that way resource development decisions are made with respect to industry, governments and affected communities, there continues to be many other important reasons to have an effective working relationships among all parties. This includes good governance, the development of mutually beneficial relationships, and gaining knowledge of the area and its resources.<br>
<br>
Many regulatory permits require that public and Aboriginal consultation be completed prior to issuance. Consultation requires effective engagement with the public and First Nations so that effective solutions can be developed.<br>
<br>
With 13 years’ experience in regulatory permitting, including extensive experience with public and Aboriginal consultation in Northern Ontario and the Arctic, Moggy Environmental has the experience necessary to effectively undertake consultation and accommodation activities.<br>
