                            ERGOREST® Forearm support is lightweight and easy movable<br>
The support is made of aluminium alloy and polyamid, the pad is upholstered with genuine leather<br>
The forearm support will be attached to table top by adjustable clamps<br>
It also has a height adjustment screw<br>
Founded nearly three decades ago in Finland, ERGOREST® has evolved at the forefront of modern ergonomics and is a distinguished leader in strain/stress injury treatment and prevention products and techniques worldwide<br>
The flagship product for ERGOREST® is their patented, modular Wrist and Forearm Support dock, which is a fully-adjustable, articulated support for elbows, forearms, and wrists<br>
As our customers often note, gel pads, so-called &quot;wrist bars&quot; and other inexpensive treatment and repetitive injury solutions are either totally useless, or are ineffective at preventing, controlling, or rehabilitating stressed, torn, or fatigued muscles, tendons, and ligaments<br>
Anything &quot;better&quot; than a gel pad or foam elevator is usually cumbersome, fragile, and/or just as useless in long-term treatment and prevention of carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injury or risk - Which is where ERGOREST® Forearm supports come onto the scene<br>
Sturdily-made, environmentally friendly, lightweight, flexible, mobile and well-built, the ERGOREST® Forearm support system is a testament to best-practices ergonomics around the globe.<br>
Available in Black, Blue, Red, Brown.<br>

                            BAT chorded keyboard - All New USB<br>
BAT Keyboard is a one-handed, compact input device that replicates all the functions of a full-size keyboard, but with greater efficiency and convenience. The BAT is easy to learn and use. Letters, numbers, commands and macros are simple key combinations, &quot;chords,&quot; that you can master in no time. Best of all the BAT&#39;s unique ergonomic design reduces hand strain and fatigue for greater comfort and productivity. The BAT is the ultimate typing solution for persons with physical or visual impairments and is proven to increase productivity when used with graphic or desktop publishing software.<br>
<br>
Best Uses for the BAT Keyboard<br>
The BAT Personal Keyboard has applicability in any computing environment, especially those using the keyboard with a mouse or other input device. The keyboard is the perfect solution for computer aided drafting, desktop publishing, graphics design and other uses such as accounting, telemarketing, or customer service. It is excellent in applications requiring only one hand. The current trend in ergonomic keyboards (splitting and separating the QWERTY keyboard) makes the BAT keyboard even more compelling for single-handed use.<br>
<br>
It is light weight and compact, takes little desk space and can easily be transported. Take the BAT keyboard with you as your personal keyboard. Use it with your laptop as a remote keyboard. It is convenient and flexible. Use the BAT keyboard in any comfortable typing position, including the arm of your chair or your lap. Use it alone, in pairs, and with other input devices, such as a traditional keyboard, a mouse or a design tablet.<br>
<br>
The BAT Personal Keyboard was developed over ten years of research by an internationally renowned human factors expert. Both the chord set and the physical design of keyboard are the results of that research. Each BAT keyboard is capable of entering all characters and functions of a traditional keyboard (plus many more) with only seven keys! Data is entered by &quot;chording&quot;: pressing a key or combination of keys simultaneously. Chords are easy to learn in about an hour. Moderate proficiency is gained in less than 10 hours, much less than with traditional keyboards. Most people achieve 30-50 wpm. Actual learning performance varies with individuals.<br>
<br>
Using the BAT Keyboard for CAD<br>
<br>
The BAT Personal Keyboard, developed by Infogrip, Inc., has gained a large following of devoted fans in the world of Computer Aided Drafting. This revolutionary ergonomic keyboard allows full keyboard entry with one hand while the other is using a pointing device; greatly reducing hand and finger movement as well as permitting the user to keep their eyes focused on the monitor.<br>
<br>
The BAT Keyboard compresses all the functions of a traditional keyboard into a seven-key unit the size of a hand. With one key for each finger and three color-coded keys for the thumb, users press key combinations, &quot;chords&quot; to type on the BAT.<br>
<br>
CAD users typically have very little desk top space, forcing them to crowd multiple items into a small area. The BAT Keyboards innovative compact design (only one-third the size of a standard keyboard) frees up valuable work space. Additionally, the BAT eliminates both the need to look away from the screen and the travel needed when moving from a mouse or digitizer to a traditional keyboard, thus enhancing the users productivity. While also reducing hand and arm movement providing a more healthy ergonomic work environment.<br>
<br>
Joe Kovalski of Accurate Design in Ventura, California uses the BAT Keyboard for CAD applications and finds it indispensable. &quot;I keep one hand on the mouse and one hand on the BAT (Keyboard), Ive memorized the keystrokes for the commands I use a lot, and its a lot faster than looking for those letters on a traditional keyboard.&quot;<br>
<br>
David Satchell a plant engineer with a computer manufacturing company in Austin, Texas quickly took to the BAT and loves it. &quot;I thought it would be difficult to learn, but I found it to be easier than learning to use a regular keyboard. All your fingers stay in the same place.&quot; Satchell said he had &quot;always been uncomfortable at a regular keyboard,&quot; and finds that using the BAT Keyboard in conjunction with a mouse helps him work faster in Auto-CAD.<br>
<br>
The BAT Keyboard is available for both PC compatible and Macintosh computers as well as having an option of left- or right-hand. (The left-hand model is the most popular.) The PC compatible is a &quot;plug and play&quot; keyboard, no driver is required. The Macintosh model plugs into the ADB port and comes with a software driver.<br>
<br>
Other features include:<br>
Flexibility. Can be used alone, in pairs, with a traditional keyboard and/or with a mouse, digitizer or other pointing device.<br>
<br>
Ergonomic design. Reduces strain and fatigue commonly associated with prolonged use of traditional keyboards and keyboard/input device travel.<br>
<br>
Both PC and Macintosh models can be daisy-chained with another BAT Keyboard and/or a traditional keyboard. All can be used simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Portability. Just 16 ounces and the size of a hand. The PC model comes with a lithium battery allowing the user to download macros to the BAT giving them the power of customized macros where ever they go.<br>
<br>
An Alternative Keyboard for Artists<br>
Not all works of art begin with the stroke of a brush. While walking through such places as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum or the Guggenheim, you may find one artist who paints to a different beat.<br>
<br>
Ron Gorchov, based in New York City, first sketches his paintings on his computer with the help of the BAT Personal Keyboard by Infogrip, Inc. before the paint ever touches the canvas.<br>
<br>
The BAT, a one-handed, seven key unit, allows your eyes to stay focused on the screen rather than on your hands. Gorchov had used the alternative keyboard for three of his past exhibitions. &quot;My hand never gets tired with the BAT because I use it just like I would play a piano ...Im not constrained,&quot; said Gorchov.<br>
<br>
The BAT, which is ergonomically designed, can be placed in any location which adds comfort and mobility whereas a traditional keyboard is placed in front of the user. Although Gorchovs computer screen is about 20 inches wide, the BAT can be used to interpret paintings of vast scales, even 20 feet.<br>
<br>
With the help of the BAT, artists like Gorchov and graphic designers are going beyond the ability of the brush and bringing the basics right to their keyboard.<br>
<br>
The BAT Keyboard and Disabilities<br>
<br>
The BAT Personal Keyboard is a fully functioning keyboard for one hand. Its innovative, compact design is ideal for individuals with physical or visual impairments. The keyboards small size allows users to easily port the BAT from home to work or school as well as place the keyboard in the most comfortable position to meet their needs.<br>
<br>
An input system called &quot;chording&quot; is used to type on the BAT. Similar to Braille combinations of keys are pressed simultaneously. The BAT has seven keys, four for the fingers and three for the thumb. The center thumb key is used in combination with the four finger keys to type &quot;space&quot; and &quot;a&quot; through &quot;z&quot;. The two outer thumb keys are used for special keys like &quot;Alt&quot;, &quot;Shift&quot; and cursor movement. &quot;Sticky&quot; or &quot;latching&quot; keys are used to enter multiple key sequences, i.e. Alt F to open a file.<br>
<br>
The BAT is a keyboard, it is not a mouse. However, all cursor movements can be achieved and with Windows 95 and System 7 for Macintosh users can turn the keypad into a mouse. If a pointing device is desired, most users mount a portable Glidepoint touchpad (available from Infogrip) just above the thumb keys or place a trackball or mouse on the low side of the BAT, thereby minimizing hand movement.<br>
<br>
Users can do anything on the BAT keyboard that they would with an extended keyboard and more.<br>

CarpalRest Document Holders<br>
It is finally here, a document holder that will fit all of your needs and store in a limited space.<br>
There are 2 basic sizes with 3 angle settings and 3 styles of lips.<br>
If none of these units fit the bill, we can custom build to your requirements.<br>
The folding lip collapses so the document holder is only 1 1/2 thick, allowing<br>
 easy storage.<br>
The surface is a durable, non-glare smooth surface perfect for writing on.<br>
The tall lip holds larger binders and books.<br>

                            Reduces or eliminates the grip force required to navigate and click traditional mice.  This ergonomically sculpted mouse is designed to support your hand comfortably without the need to clutch the mouse to control it. Four right hand sizes and three left hand sizes properly fit your hand so you are not trying to navigate a mouse that is too small for your hand. You escape the habit of pinching a small mouse on the sides while curling your fingertips back to click on the buttons.  Excessive clutching and finger flexing can aggravate the carpal tunnel and result in repetitive strain injuries such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Tendonitis.<br>
<br>
A pronounced hump on the top of the mouse supports the bones in your hand from underneath, just like an orthopedic arch in a well constructed athletic shoe. The specially designed arch fills the hollow of your palm and allows you to rest your hand on top of the mouse.  This arch promotes straight alignment of your hand and wrist bones and slightly elevates your wrist off of the working surface.  This helps to break the harmful habit of resting your wrist on the desk or mouse pad and pivoting the mouse from side to side.  That pivoting can cause pain and discomfort as the forearm bones (radius and ulna) twist in directions not easily tolerated by human physiology.<br>
<br>
Elongated buttons allow you to use the second knuckle of your finger to activate clicks, which uses a stronger, thicker tendon. On smaller, conventional mice, most users pull their fingertips back in order to activate the mouse buttons.  The Contour Mouse allows you to rest your hand on top of the mouse and activate the buttons with small, subtle motions without flexing your fingers.  Please view the product video on this web page for a more detailed visual demonstration of this advantage. The elimination of flexing reduces carpal tunnel use and the threat of repetitive strain injuries.<br>
<br>
Customize your mouse with your choice of Black or White color, Right or Left handed, with or without a scroll wheel, available in four different sizes. There is a Contour Mouse that is right for you and your work habits as well as your hand size.  One size doesnt fit all in shoe sizes and hand sizes are similar.<br>
<br>
Convenient, out of the box, plug and play connectivity for both PC and Mac computers.  This HID compliant device has the drivers on board and simply needs to be plugged into any empty USB port, without the need for a cumbersome connection routine.<br>
<br>
Powerful scientific research went in before the product went out.  The owner of Contour Design worked with ten CAD/CAM engineers who suffered with carpal tunnel pain in a lab for eighteen months to develop the current Contour Mouse design.  They evolved through 120 different molds before they were satisfied.  The final design allowed the injured engineers to work for eight hours without pain.<br>
<br>
17 degree pronation angle relieves pressure on the forearm bones while still minimizing grip force. The design team considered more vertical designs in the development phase, but found that more grip force was required in order to activate the buttons.  They found that a 17 degree angle relative to the working surface to be the right balance, relieving pressure from crossing the forearm bones caused by true palm down devices.<br>

                            Roller Mouse - Eliminates reaching for a traditional mouse, relieving neck, shoulder and elbow pain. Asymmetrical reaching with one side of your body and not the other causes your muscle groups to compensate for the weight of your extended arm while reaching for a traditional mouse. Repetitive reaching oftentimes leads to tightness and pain in the neck, shoulder and elbow areas. The RollerMouse Free allows you to keep your elbows comfortably by your side, which is a more beneficial ergonomic position. Thousands of users have thanked us due to the pain relief they have realized after using the RollerMouse for a short period of time. Please review the testimonials linked to this page for their direct feedback.<br>
<br>
There is no gripping necessary, thus avoiding the threat of Repetitive Strain Injuries such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Tendonitis. The RollerMouse Free is controlled with the use of an unflexed hand, so there is no need to clutch or hold the device in order to navigate the cursor. Your fingertips roll a narrow bar both up and down and from side to side simultaneously to navigate the cursor over the entire screen, with very little friction or resistance. The elimination of flexing your fingers avoids activity through the carpal tunnel, overuse of a traditional mouse can aggravate the carpal tunnel and lead to numbness, tingling and pain.<br>
<br>
Promotes the equal use of both hands, reducing the risk of injuring your dominant mousing hand. With the mouse buttons centered beneath the keyboard home keys, mouse control is equidistant from either hand. Ambidextrous use is encouraged and easily accomplished with your command buttons literally at your fingertips, for both hands.<br>

                            STOP PAIN  REDUCE PAIN<br>
<br>
Enjoy the ease, comfort and powerful functional capabilities of this revolutionary medical imaging device.  The Rx Shuttle Pro was developed with the collaboration of a prominent Radiologist at Mass General Hospital in Boston.  As the number of images became greater per case, the arduous task of scanning through images for diagnostic review started to cause the Radiologist pain while using a traditional mouse.<br>
<br>
The ultimate solution became the 15 button, jog wheel centric Rx Shuttle Pro.  This device works with popular PACS software packages to enable Radiologists to review cases with increased speed and reduced pain.<br>
<br>
Eliminates Grip Force.<br>
The Rx Shuttle Pro uses a central jog wheel with seven forward and seven reverse speeds.  This makes image viewing easy and painless.  Hundreds or Thousands of images can be scanned within a minute, without clutching and dragging a traditional mouse.  This elimination of constantly gripping a traditional mouse allows for greater productivity and comfort.  Within the jog wheel is a frame by frame advance wheel that increases the accuracy of reviewing specific images for review.<br>
<br>
Robust 15 Function button array reduces reaching and typing.<br>
The Rx Shuttle Pro has fifteen programmable buttons to handle the most frequently used functions performed by the Radiologist.  These buttons have custom programmable capabilities, or can be set to match the functional mapping included with popular PACS software programs.  Regardless of the source, single button activations replace multiple keystroke and function key clicks, reducing reaching and fatigue.<br>
<br>
Compatible with most popular PACS software drivers.<br>
The Rx Shuttle Pro is compatible with PACS software drivers from G.E., Phillips, McKesson and AGFA.  We offer these drivers as accessories that can be purchased along with the Rx Shuttle Pro unit.  The CD ROM containing the desired drivers will be placed inside the box with the original shipment.  These popular function sets make diagnosis and imaging navigation a breeze.<br>
<br>
Plug and Play convenience on both Windows and Apple operating systems.<br>
The RX Shuttle Pro works both with PC based and Mac based operating systems with ease.  Simply plug the USB connector into any available port and the device operates automatically.<br>

                            Evoluent LLC is the inventor of the handshake grip<br>
The Evoluent Vertical Mouse 3 is the advanced third generation of the revolutionary<br>
mouse that amazingly relieved wrist and arm pain - according to many user reports<br>
The shape has been further refined in subtle details based on the<br>
ergonomic lessons learned from the previous two generations<br>
Eliminates arm twisting<br>
The patented shape supports your hand in a fully upright handshake position that eliminates forearm twisting.<br>
Many users said earlier models relieved their hand, wrist, or arm pain<br>
An ordinary horizontal mouse requires your forearm to twist away from its natural position<br>
Familiar grip<br>
The grip is the same as an ordinary mouse, just turned sideways<br>
Most users said they got used to it very quickly<br>
The VerticalMouse does not move sideways when clicking with normal force because the thumb naturally opposes the fingers<br>
Pointer control is as accurate as any other good mouse when the pointer speed settings are properly adjusted<br>
Easy to use buttons ALL 5 buttons are easily operable without contorting your fingers<br>
The button force is light for easy clicking, but still firm enough to avoid accidental actuation<br>
Special Features - XPP and Vista only<br>
Speed toggle - cycle among up to 3 pointer speed settings by keyboard shortcut or mouse button - For example, a high speed for ordinary tasks, and a slow speed for graphics work<br>
Auto click - automatically perform a single or double click by pausing the pointer. Adjustable time delay for activation<br>
Click lock - press and hold a button momentarily to simulate continued pressing without holding down the button. Adjustable time delay for activation.<br>
Break Reminder - visual and/or audio alerts to remind you to take a break.<br>

                            Polymer Footrest - Make Workstations Comfortable!<br>
Help your back feel better with our new quality constructed solid polymerfootrest.<br>
It promotes proper posture thus making you more comfortable.<br>
Available either Grey or Black this attractive and long lasting solid polymer footrest features a special high-friction surface that is environmentallystabilized to resist harsh sun light including ultraviolet light.<br>
The surface has a dot pattern texture that inhibits slippage.<br>
It is not a laminated surface, but instead it is a single homogeneous polymer sheet that will not rot, swell, or delaminate when exposed to sun or moisture.<br>
Our solid polymer footrest providesa practical ergonomic solution for workstations that require cleaning or disinfecting.<br>
The footrest is chemically resistant and most common detergents and cleansers work well to remove soil.<br>
Bleach can be applied and allowed to soak to help lift persistent stains.<br>
To clean a petroleum based stains such as grease or oil, use citrus cleaner, alcohol, or mineral spirits.<br>
Furniture polish or products such as Armor-All can add an attractive luster to the finish and hide small mars on the product&#39;s surface.<br>
However, the use of such polishing agents reduces the coefficient of surface adhesion.  <br>

CarpalRest Document Holders - 24&quot; x 12&quot;<br>
It is finally here, a document holder that will fit all of your needs and store in a limited space.<br>
There are 2 basic sizes with 3 angle settings and 3 styles of lips.<br>
If none of these units fit the bill, we can custom build to your requirements.<br>
The folding lip collapses so the document holder is only 1 1/2 thick, allowing<br>
easy storage.<br>
The surface is a durable, non-glare smooth surface perfect for writing on.<br>
 The tall lip holds larger binders and books.<br>

A tiny single-button mouse with no scroll wheel, thats easy to control and made of rugged plastic for strength and durability.<br>

                            Microphone - Voice Tracker Array<br>
The Voice Tracker Array microphone has been Certified by Dragon and ViaVoice speech recognition software, HomeSeer and HAL Home Automation software, and unlike first generation array microphones which have a fixed &quot;listen&quot; direction, the Acoustic Magic Voice Tracker Array Microphone automatically locates and electronically steers toward the talker<br>
Used in speech recognition, meeting and transcription recording, VoIP and conventional teleconferencing, voice control for home automation, and security surveillance.<br>
The Voice Tracker Array Microphone is unique in the market place because it has eight microphone elements that scan 360 degrees continuously<br>
This allows the Voice Tracker to locate a talker from ranges of 20&#39; or more<br>
The microphone elements electronically steer a listening beam, like an acoustic searchlight, in the direction of the talker in a few milliseconds<br>
Spatial filtering, so sounds from other parts of the room are not picked up<br>
In addition, the Voice Tracker removes stationary background noise with digital noise reduction algorithms <br>

                            The ScannaR is a flatbed scanner that will scan any text document and read it back to you in seconds.<br>
<br>
Unlike other scan-and-read products, it does not need to be connected to a PC, as it has its own hard drive with room for up to 500,000 pages of text, making it one of the most portable scan-and-read products on the market.<br>
<br>
Picture of people using ScannerR unitScannaR allows you to read anything from letters and brochures to newspapers, reports, books or other print materials, and then save them for future reference.<br>
<br>
ScannaR is not only great for the home or office. It is an ideal tool for educators and students at all levels for quickly scanning and recording textbooks, worksheets, tests and exams. Because of its audio output as well as the bonus ability to download files to a BrailleNote or VoiceNote, it is suitable for environments where resources are shared among students who either have low vision or are blind.<br>

The history of Basic<br>
Basic Blue Bar was developed in 1988 and 1989 as part of our first generation modern braille embossers. It came in two models, classic and advanced. The small, light and efficient Basic was received well by our customers, which spurred further development.<br>
<br>
In 1995 Basic V2 was introduced. It looked like Basic does today, a well known and much liked design. With V2 there was a choice between single- or double sided embossing.<br>
<br>
In 2003 Basic V3 took the next step forward. All modern Basic embossers use the latest Braille technology, including double sided embossing, USB and Network support.<br>

Flexi-Paper - Flexible - Durable - Portable - Error Free<br>
These are the properties that make Flexi - Paper Tactile<br>
Imaging Paper the most unique product ever developed for the production of tactile images<br>
Flexi-Paper is imaged by drawing upon it with a soft lead pencil or printing on it with an HP InkJet printer. <br>
Then passed through the TIE and Tactile documents are created.<br>
Flexi-Paper documents are so durable that they can be folded, even crumbled into a ball and the tactile image will NOT be distorted. <br>
Of equal importance the paper will not crease. <br>
A crease has the potential of transmitting false information as a distorted tactile image.<br>

                            BackTpack - The Healthy Way to Carry<br>
        BackTpack was designed by a physical therapist as a remedy for the poor posture and pain associated with everyday backpack use such as school, travel, and commuting. Better than a backpack, BackTpacks ergonomic side bag system applies a balanced load onto the vertical spinal axis, prompting you to stand straight and tall. With good posture, your bones, muscles, and all the systems of the body work in harmony with gravity the foundation of fitness and injury prevention.<br>
        Common backpacks require you to lean forward to compensate for the load on the back. This posture leads to back, neck and shoulder pain. BackTpack allows you to stand, walk, and sit with your spine and head tall and your shoulders relaxed in a healthy posture. No more twisting and bending to access items.<br>
        Training these postural habits will contribute to lifelong healthy movement and a strong skeleton. The load feels much lighter, and when applied in this manner becomes your friend not your burden, encouraging your body to be strong, upright, graceful and free.<br>
        Note: All bags are free of latex or natural rubber.<br>
<br>
    BackTPack Belt for Hip Loading - Included<br>
        One size fits all.<br>
        Adjustable web belt for hip loading option.<br>
        Size: One inch wide nylon webbing<br>
        Adjustable in length: 29&quot; - 54&quot; | 73.7 - 137.2 cm<br>
        Color: Black<br>
    BackTpack and the Laws of Physics<br>
        Unlike backpacks or messenger bags, BackTpack, with its balanced side bags, applies the load to the bodys vertical axis, thereby eliminating posture distortion and decreasing the effort required to carry the load, in obedience to the laws of physics. The load feels lighter and you stand straighter.<br>
            The center of gravity:<br>
                When we support a weight, we have a new center of gravity -- the combination of our body&#39;s center of gravity plus the center of gravity of the weight we are supporting. When what we carry is balanced left-right or front-back, or is on top of the head, its center of gravity aligns vertically with ours.<br>
                However, if the weight is off-axis (in front, to one side, or behind), we must lean away from the load to keep our new center of gravity over our feet so that we don&#39;t fall.  Posture must change to accommodate the bag we carry, and the heavier the load, the more we must lean.<br>
            The line of force:<br>
                The force applied to support the load must go through the center of gravity of the load.  So again, when the load is balanced, or on our head, the supporting force is simply equal to the weight we carry, and in the opposite direction: straight up!<br>
                When the weight is off-axis, we must pull in a direction such that the direction of the pull goes through the center of gravity of the load.  This introduces a horizontal component to the force, which is added to the weight, meaning that more force is required.  Put another way, a heavy backpack requires you to lean forward and pull forward with your shoulders.  This is why you see hunched shoulders and forward heads with backpack use.  With the same load in a BackTpack, you eliminate the forward pull.<br>

                It is also the reason that people say, &quot;The load feels lighter!&quot; when they try on a BackTpack loaded with the contents of their conventional backpack.<br>
            Adjustable shoulder straps<br>
                Padded for comfort<br>
                Secured in place by an adjustable sternum strap, so they never fall off your shoulders<br>
            Adjustable SIT-STRAP<br>
                This unique feature is essential for spinal health. Since you should not apply a load to a flexed spine (as when seated), the SIT-STRAP transfers the weight immediately off the shoulders and spine to the thighs without removing shoulder straps<br>
                The bags will remain accessible at our sides if you choose to remove shoulder straps<br>
            Padded bottoms and side panels against your body<br>

    Who can Penfriend benefit?<br>
    Physical Disabilities<br>
        Penfriend is the ideal tool to help people with Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Stroke, limb deformities and any condition where the physical effort of typing is difficult.<br>
        It speeds up writing by cutting down the number of keystrokes needed to write a document. The only comparison (Ch 14 p 164) between predictors we know of showed that Penfriend saved more keystrokes than any other program.<br>
        The on-screen keyboard may be the only means of writing using a mouse controlled by hand, head or foot<br>
        Abbreviation expansion speeds the typing of common phrases or text such as one&#39;s address.<br>
        Switch access provided through other programs such as the integration with Clicker enables to severely physically handicapped to write.<br>
    Word prediction<br>
        Word prediction is very valuable for those with dyslexia where recognising a correctly spelt word offered by the predictor is easier than thinking how to spell it in the first place.<br>
        Better spelling, grammar, thesaurus, dictionaries<br>
        Better spelling and grammar helps many but particularly those with dyslexia. Knowing that Penfriend provides correctly spelt words gives greater confidence.<br>
        The access provided by Penfriend XL to Microsoft Word&#39;s spell checking, thesaurus, dictionaries and translation is of great help to any with dyslexia.<br>
    Speech Feedback and Screen Reading<br>
        Another benefit of Penfriend for those with dyslexia is it&#39;s speech feedback and in Penfriend XL its screen reading features.<br>
        Being able to hear each letter, word or sentence vocalized as you type is of very obvious value to those with dyslexia, but Penfriend also allows you to highlight a block of text or an entire document and have it read back to you. This not only allows dyslexic people to understand the contents of a document they may not be able to read, but also helps them to associate the sound of a word with how it looks on the page.<br>
    On-screen keyboard<br>
        Penfriend&#39;s on-screen keyboard reduces the strain of glancing between screen and keyboard, a valuable tool for the dyslexic using a computer.<br>
        Faster writing of longer tasks for those with<br>
    Visual Impairment<br>
        One can change the font size in Penfriend to make it easier for those with poor sight to see the predictions and controls in Penfriend.<br>
        When screen reading, open the clipboard in a convenient position, then everything read appears in the clipboard at the same position on the screen and in the font size being used in Penfriend.<br>
    Speed<br>
        Penfriend saves key-strokes by typing letters for you. This helps writers to get more on paper in the same time, and to write more before they get tired.<br>
        In a detailed academic study of supportive writing software by the CALL Centre, Penfriend was found to be the most effective word predictor. It saved around 65% of keystrokes (more than any other product), and predicted the correct word by the time the first letter had been typed in around 70% of cases (again, the best).<br>
    Screen Reading<br>
        Penfriend XL comes with a screen reading and text magnification facility, just click on the folders on your desktop or read web pages and hear them read with native voices. Speak the list of words offered by your word processor&#39;s thesaurus or spell checker.<br>
        The spoken text is transferred automatically to the clipboard where, if a large font is used, it can be magnified for those with visual impairment. There is an icon in the clipboard which allows you to switch the screen reading on and off at a single click.<br>
        The speech feedback facility in both Penfriend XP and XL means that it also speaks back the text you are writing. It can be configured to speak each letter as it is typed, each word as it is completed, and each sentence. It can read words from the prediction list when you point at them, when you choose them, or automatically when they change. It can also read back whole paragraphs (or more) of text from other applications using the clipboard. This might be your document, a web page, an email, or almost anything else.<br>
        While speaking text from the clipboard, a window can be shown which follows the voice, highlighting each word as it goes. You can click on a word to hear it again, or to speak a fragment of the text. This can be used in conjunction with the screen reading to enlarge and highlight words being read from web pages or the desktop.<br>
    Spell checking, Thesaurus and Dictionary<br>
        The screen reader in Penfriend XL makes it possible to read and highlight alternative spellings, synonyms and dictionary meanings available in Microsoft Word. These can all be read out, and if necessary magnified,on a right click.Thus although it does not have a spell checker built in, it gives direct access to the excellent Spell Checking, Thesaurus and Dictionary available in MS Word.<br>
    Lexicon Editing and Topic Lexicons<br>
    Lexicon Editing<br>
        Penfriend doesn&#39;t claim to know all the words you want to write in advance, but it is very good at learning them. Every word you type is analysed, and Penfriend can learn those it doesn&#39;t recognise. Depending on your spelling, you might ask for new words to be predicted immediately (as appropriate), or perhaps just to be remembered and then checked by a teacher.<br>
    Lexicon Editing<br>
        Another feature is the ability to ban words. Thus risqué words, or words that a child should be able to spell can be banned, so that they are never predicted.<br>
        Penfriend holds new words in a specially marked list, so that you can easily review the ones it has learnt recently. There are various tools for manipulating these, such as approving only those used several times. This is also a useful tool for a teacher to see the spelling errors that a child is making.<br>
        As well as learning new words, Penfriend keeps track of the ones you&#39;ve used, and your style of writing. This all helps to predict the right words next time!<br>
    Topic Lexicons<br>
        Often you want specific vocabulary for a particular topic. One of the major advantages of Penfriend is that it is very easy to teach it new words either from the clipboard or a text file. Thus if you have a document with the words you want to use in it, it takes seconds to teach the program these words. They can then either be kept for the future or used for that one session. It is your choice.<br>
    Word Prediction - Prediction Window<br>
        Penfriend word prediction software suggests words, as you type text into your preferred word processor or text editor.<br>
        Penfriend XP can predict the next word you want to write in English and Penfriend XL can do so in many languages.<br>
        Penfriend is very good at guessing the word you are typing after you have entered one or two initial letters. One key press, or one mouse click on your chosen word in the prediction window, then completes the word for you.<br>
        Penfriend will then go on to predict the next complete word you want to type and it is almost always very successful in doing so. It is in fact possible to write an entire document simply by clicking on Penfriend&#39;s suggested words in the prediction window, after typing in only the first few letters.<br>
        One user commented that &quot;This software is spookily good at prediction&quot;.<br>
        Penfriend&#39;s word prediction uses a dictionary of known words, along with detailed knowledge of when they are likely to be used and words you have used before. Every time you type a letter, it comes up with a new list of the most likely words which fit your letters. Choosing one is a simple matter of pressing one more button, or clicking on the word with the mouse. If you&#39;re not sure how to read it, you can hear it spoken before you choose a word. This is valuable for those who have physical disabilities or dyslexia. But it will also help those wanting to write in a language that they are learning.<br>
        Minimising the predictor window switches off prediction and all the assistive functions in Penfriend. Useful if you want to type an email address without spaces after the full stop, or type numbers whilst predicting using number keys.<br>
<br>
    On-screen Keyboard<br>
        Penfriend XL comes with keyboards for many languages where their colour and size and font size can be adjusted to suit the user. Anyone can type easily in a foreign language.<br>
        On-Screen Keyboard<br>
        The on-screen keyboards in both the XP (English only) and XL (multi-language) versions of Penfriend will be particularly useful for people either with physical disabilities affecting their use of a keyboard, or for those with dyslexia by reducing the visual strain of glancing repeatedly between the screen and keyboard.<br>
        It is also useful to anyone wanting to type in a language that is different from the default language on the users computer. Typing French on a computer set up for use in the UK or German on a computer set up for use in France becomes simple with Penfriend XL&#39;s keyboards.<br>
        There are now additional characters such as Â,[,],@,# available via the Alt key. And the English keyboard now has the accented characters used in Gaelic.<br>

        Worries about navigation are eliminated as users can maneuver up to the workstation and have full reach capabilities.<br>
    Motorized adjustments provide easy accommodations<br>
        With the touch of a button, the TAP-it platform can move up or down and the 42&quot; interactive LCD panel can be tilted from 0 - 90 degrees.<br>
        These adjustments make TAP-it infinitely more accessible to physically challenged students and their instructors than stationary wall-mounted boards.<br>

    TAP-it: Creating a Custom Fit for Success<br>
        Finding assistive technology that serves the needs of multiple individuals with a variety of special needs is challenging.<br>
        Meet Bre, a bright and witty 9-year-old with congenital limb deficiencies and an extraordinary sense of courage and determination.<br>
        Whether she is using her motorized wheelchair or modeling her new prosthetic legs, the Touch Accessible<br>
    Platform for Interactive Technology (TAP-it)<br>
        Accommodates her individual needs with its wide base, tilt angles, and height adjustment capabilities.<br>
        TAP-it uses Intended Touch technology, which means it recognizes the difference between purposeful and accidental interactions with the screen.<br>
        Any software used on a computer can easily be used on this touch-sensitive platform.<br>
    The TAP-it interactive workstation responds to a variety of stylists, including:<br>
        Pointers<br>
        Mouth Sticks<br>
        Head Pointers<br>
        Switches/Scanners<br>
        Balls<br>
        On-Screen Keyboards<br>
    Serving a wide range of students special needs, TAP-it provides multiple modes of learning to accommodate tactile, visual and auditory learners, as well as those with:<br>
        Traumatic Brain Injury<br>
        Down Syndrome<br>
        Intellectual Disabilities<br>
        Autism Spectrum Disorder<br>
        Cerebral Palsy<br>
        Spinal Cord Injuries<br>
        ADD &amp; ADHD<br>
        Learning Disabilities<br>
        Vision &amp; Hearing Disabilities<br>
        Sensory Processing Disorders<br>
        Muscular Dystrophy<br>
    TAP-it truly helps lay the groundwork for success. The customizable design allows students like Bre to focus on what matters most: their education.<br>
    Accessibility -<br>
        TAP-it provides a touch accessible interactive learning platform that supports shared occupational therapy and academic goals to become a transformative classroom tool for students and educators.<br>
        It minimizes barriers and maximizes flexibility by adapting to the individual needs of students.<br>
    Fine Motor Delays <br>
        Students can operate the screen using a finger, assistive device, or reach stick.<br>
        Larger icons help them select the correct target to make their choices.<br>
        The work area is designed to ensure that the majority of students are able to reach the entire surface.<br>
    Involuntary Arm Movements <br>
        Students can use the interface to press the large virtual icons.<br>
        This helps to accommodate their lack of precision and accuracy in directing the mouse pointer.<br>
    Visually Impaired <br>
        TAP-it works with any software on your computer allowing teachers, students and parents to resize text and graphics, adjust brightness or contrast controls, and enlarge images or change background colors within seconds.<br>
        The low-glare, matte finish display is shadow-free, providing optimal viewing for low-vision users.<br>
    Hearing Impaired <br>
        Finger-touch input keeps hands free of pen tools that interfere with signing. Interactive media keeps students engaged.<br>
        They can read from the board and sign at the same time, increasing opportunities for communication between teachers and students.<br>
    Developmental Delays <br>
        TAP-it offers ongoing visual reinforcement to complement lessons and improve functional capabilities.<br>
        While their eye movement increases, students with ASD, ADD, etc, can track content with greater ease.<br>
        The physical interaction and visual stimulus offers an additional sensory channel to help process information.<br>
    Applications <br>
        Any software, switch or website you currently use works with TAP-it.<br>
        Use Boardmaker, Starfall or News2you for read out loud Speech/Language activities.<br>
        Occupational therapists can practice cause and effect, eye tracking, and extended reach capabilities with gaming software and websites. Zoomtext is a favorite among teachers who work with the visually challenged.<br>
        Every teacher has a preference, and if you use it on your computer, you can use it on TAPit.<br>
    Warranty <br>
        TAP-it is protected by a three-year parts and labor warranty.<br>

                            Saddle and Pony Saddle Seats<br>
Saddle and Pony Saddle seats, part of Humanscales award-winning Freedom seating line, are the most comfortable and versatile stools ever made. The original Saddle and the more compact Pony Saddle accommodate comfortable seating in countless applications. These stools encourage you to sit in a saddle posture, which lowers the thighs, opens up the hips and puts the spine into a healthy lordotic curve. The stools are ideal for shorter term sittingor even for getting your feet up off the ground by using it as an ottoman.<br>

                            Oyster ambidextrous ergo mouse<br>
Oyster Mouse is an ergonomic mouse with 5 repositionable mouse angles and is suitable for both left-handed and right-handed users. <br>
<br>
The Oyster Mouse is an award winning design by Ergoption that is the only fully adjustable ergonomic mouse: you can instantly adjust the mouse to 5 different angles to intuitively find the best posture for you.

The Oyster Mouse Wireless is perfectly ambidextrous allowing an equally comfortable computing experience for both right and left hand users. This feature makes it ideal for companies that sup-ply their employees with mice. There is no guessing, or asking, what kind they need. <br>
<br>
The Oyster Mouse Wireless is winner of the 2011 National Ergonomics Conference and Exposition Attendees Choice Award. <br>

Cloud-Based Multilingual Solution<br>
ReadSpeaker Enterprise Highlighting consists of a Listen button and an integrated fully keyboard-controllable audio player. In our latest release, we have updated our player to the latest web standards (HTML5/CSS3), requiring fewer images and no Flash, while making the design and functionality more user-friendly. We also offer several ways for you to easily customize our player to better match the design of your website. ReadSpeaker Enterprise Highlighting works on all devices and browsers, even the latest iOS and Android devices. <br>
<br>
The Web-Reading Experience<br>
When your user clicks the Listen button, ReadSpeaker Enterprise Highlighting opens our player and starts reading the content of the page. The text is also highlighted while it is being read, reinforcing a better understanding of the text. The settings menu enables your users to customize the reading experience. They can control the reading speed and how the text is highlighted, either sentence by sentence or word by word. They can select text to only listen to certain parts of the page.

              My name is Ann Miller. I am a retired lady with multiple disabilities and I am a client of Special Needs Computers.<br>
<br>
I have nothing but praise for the care and honesty, as well as the dedication of Terry Scott and his team. My computer is wonderful! It was set up, all programs installed, in the time requested by me. <br>
<br>
I was truly impressed by the promises kept, the training provided and most of all, my specific needs met. All this was accomplished with my financial restrictions in mind. <br>
I am still in the process of learning all the different software and hardware that was recommended as I am not very computer literate, at least, not yet! I am sure that by the time my training is complete I will be totally comfortable with my system. The whole process has been a great experience for me.<br>
<br>
In closing, I would not hesitate to recommend Special Needs Computers to anyone, especially those of us who have Special Needs. <br>

I found Terrys (computer needs) assessment of my disabilities to be right on. His listening skills were wonderful and his ability to purchase software for my business was excellent. The assistive devices he purchased for me have been a great help and because of them I am able to work a few more hours each day. This is an accomplishment in itself. <br>
<br>
Terrys personality is non-threatening and a person you can invite into your home. Terry has a unique was of putting computer jargon into laymans terms. He always returns phone calls or emails promptly. I would recommend Terrys work to anyone. Karen Mitchinson.<br>

Hi, my name is Mark Furness. I have dealt with several ADP Vendors over a 10-year period. Many times, my friends have asked me for advice in what to look for in a computer system. It is with personal experience and great sincerity I state that no other vendor has provided such an excellent system as Terry Scott from<br>

                            This &quot;mother of all workstations&quot; offers a curvilinear design that wraps the computer monitors around the user, addressing important human factors too often forgotten in the workplace<br>
It is a &quot;person-centered&quot; design that offers a safe, comfortable workspace for any occupation that&#39;s computer intensive<br>
#<br>
Making frequent height adjustments as the day progresses is an important step in minimizing eye strain and repetitive stress injuries<br>
With the push of a button, the Command Center adjusts to the appropriate task height in no time, from 27&quot; - 39&quot; | 68.6 - 99.1 cm in height<br>
The ample tabletop easily raises and lowers as many as 4 large monitors-up to 450 lbs. | of equipment<br>
The keyboarding surface can adjust independently to 7&quot; | 18 cm above or 4&quot; | 11 cm below the work surface with a simple lift and lock motion<br>

                            ERGOREST® Forearm support is lightweight and easy movable<br>
The support is made of aluminium alloy and polyamid, the pad is upholstered with genuine leather<br>
The forearm support will be attached to table top by adjustable clamps<br>
It also has a height adjustment screw<br>
Founded nearly three decades ago in Finland, ERGOREST® has evolved at the forefront of modern ergonomics and is a distinguished leader in strain/stress injury treatment and prevention products and techniques worldwide<br>
The flagship product for ERGOREST® is their patented, modular Wrist and Forearm Support dock, which is a fully-adjustable, articulated support for elbows, forearms, and wrists<br>
As our customers often note, gel pads, so-called &quot;wrist bars&quot; and other inexpensive treatment and repetitive injury solutions are either totally useless, or are ineffective at preventing, controlling, or rehabilitating stressed, torn, or fatigued muscles, tendons, and ligaments<br>
Anything &quot;better&quot; than a gel pad or foam elevator is usually cumbersome, fragile, and/or just as useless in long-term treatment and prevention of carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injury or risk - Which is where ERGOREST® Forearm supports come onto the scene<br>
Sturdily-made, environmentally friendly, lightweight, flexible, mobile and well-built, the ERGOREST® Forearm support system is a testament to best-practices ergonomics around the globe.<br>
Available in Black, Blue, Red, Brown.<br>

                            BAT chorded keyboard - All New USB<br>
BAT Keyboard is a one-handed, compact input device that replicates all the functions of a full-size keyboard, but with greater efficiency and convenience. The BAT is easy to learn and use. Letters, numbers, commands and macros are simple key combinations, &quot;chords,&quot; that you can master in no time. Best of all the BAT&#39;s unique ergonomic design reduces hand strain and fatigue for greater comfort and productivity. The BAT is the ultimate typing solution for persons with physical or visual impairments and is proven to increase productivity when used with graphic or desktop publishing software.<br>
<br>
Best Uses for the BAT Keyboard<br>
The BAT Personal Keyboard has applicability in any computing environment, especially those using the keyboard with a mouse or other input device. The keyboard is the perfect solution for computer aided drafting, desktop publishing, graphics design and other uses such as accounting, telemarketing, or customer service. It is excellent in applications requiring only one hand. The current trend in ergonomic keyboards (splitting and separating the QWERTY keyboard) makes the BAT keyboard even more compelling for single-handed use.<br>
<br>
It is light weight and compact, takes little desk space and can easily be transported. Take the BAT keyboard with you as your personal keyboard. Use it with your laptop as a remote keyboard. It is convenient and flexible. Use the BAT keyboard in any comfortable typing position, including the arm of your chair or your lap. Use it alone, in pairs, and with other input devices, such as a traditional keyboard, a mouse or a design tablet.<br>
<br>
The BAT Personal Keyboard was developed over ten years of research by an internationally renowned human factors expert. Both the chord set and the physical design of keyboard are the results of that research. Each BAT keyboard is capable of entering all characters and functions of a traditional keyboard (plus many more) with only seven keys! Data is entered by &quot;chording&quot;: pressing a key or combination of keys simultaneously. Chords are easy to learn in about an hour. Moderate proficiency is gained in less than 10 hours, much less than with traditional keyboards. Most people achieve 30-50 wpm. Actual learning performance varies with individuals.<br>
<br>
Using the BAT Keyboard for CAD<br>
<br>
The BAT Personal Keyboard, developed by Infogrip, Inc., has gained a large following of devoted fans in the world of Computer Aided Drafting. This revolutionary ergonomic keyboard allows full keyboard entry with one hand while the other is using a pointing device; greatly reducing hand and finger movement as well as permitting the user to keep their eyes focused on the monitor.<br>
<br>
The BAT Keyboard compresses all the functions of a traditional keyboard into a seven-key unit the size of a hand. With one key for each finger and three color-coded keys for the thumb, users press key combinations, &quot;chords&quot; to type on the BAT.<br>
<br>
CAD users typically have very little desk top space, forcing them to crowd multiple items into a small area. The BAT Keyboards innovative compact design (only one-third the size of a standard keyboard) frees up valuable work space. Additionally, the BAT eliminates both the need to look away from the screen and the travel needed when moving from a mouse or digitizer to a traditional keyboard, thus enhancing the users productivity. While also reducing hand and arm movement providing a more healthy ergonomic work environment.<br>
<br>
Joe Kovalski of Accurate Design in Ventura, California uses the BAT Keyboard for CAD applications and finds it indispensable. &quot;I keep one hand on the mouse and one hand on the BAT (Keyboard), Ive memorized the keystrokes for the commands I use a lot, and its a lot faster than looking for those letters on a traditional keyboard.&quot;<br>
<br>
David Satchell a plant engineer with a computer manufacturing company in Austin, Texas quickly took to the BAT and loves it. &quot;I thought it would be difficult to learn, but I found it to be easier than learning to use a regular keyboard. All your fingers stay in the same place.&quot; Satchell said he had &quot;always been uncomfortable at a regular keyboard,&quot; and finds that using the BAT Keyboard in conjunction with a mouse helps him work faster in Auto-CAD.<br>
<br>
The BAT Keyboard is available for both PC compatible and Macintosh computers as well as having an option of left- or right-hand. (The left-hand model is the most popular.) The PC compatible is a &quot;plug and play&quot; keyboard, no driver is required. The Macintosh model plugs into the ADB port and comes with a software driver.<br>
<br>
Other features include:<br>
Flexibility. Can be used alone, in pairs, with a traditional keyboard and/or with a mouse, digitizer or other pointing device.<br>
<br>
Ergonomic design. Reduces strain and fatigue commonly associated with prolonged use of traditional keyboards and keyboard/input device travel.<br>
<br>
Both PC and Macintosh models can be daisy-chained with another BAT Keyboard and/or a traditional keyboard. All can be used simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Portability. Just 16 ounces and the size of a hand. The PC model comes with a lithium battery allowing the user to download macros to the BAT giving them the power of customized macros where ever they go.<br>
<br>
An Alternative Keyboard for Artists<br>
Not all works of art begin with the stroke of a brush. While walking through such places as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum or the Guggenheim, you may find one artist who paints to a different beat.<br>
<br>
Ron Gorchov, based in New York City, first sketches his paintings on his computer with the help of the BAT Personal Keyboard by Infogrip, Inc. before the paint ever touches the canvas.<br>
<br>
The BAT, a one-handed, seven key unit, allows your eyes to stay focused on the screen rather than on your hands. Gorchov had used the alternative keyboard for three of his past exhibitions. &quot;My hand never gets tired with the BAT because I use it just like I would play a piano ...Im not constrained,&quot; said Gorchov.<br>
<br>
The BAT, which is ergonomically designed, can be placed in any location which adds comfort and mobility whereas a traditional keyboard is placed in front of the user. Although Gorchovs computer screen is about 20 inches wide, the BAT can be used to interpret paintings of vast scales, even 20 feet.<br>
<br>
With the help of the BAT, artists like Gorchov and graphic designers are going beyond the ability of the brush and bringing the basics right to their keyboard.<br>
<br>
The BAT Keyboard and Disabilities<br>
<br>
The BAT Personal Keyboard is a fully functioning keyboard for one hand. Its innovative, compact design is ideal for individuals with physical or visual impairments. The keyboards small size allows users to easily port the BAT from home to work or school as well as place the keyboard in the most comfortable position to meet their needs.<br>
<br>
An input system called &quot;chording&quot; is used to type on the BAT. Similar to Braille combinations of keys are pressed simultaneously. The BAT has seven keys, four for the fingers and three for the thumb. The center thumb key is used in combination with the four finger keys to type &quot;space&quot; and &quot;a&quot; through &quot;z&quot;. The two outer thumb keys are used for special keys like &quot;Alt&quot;, &quot;Shift&quot; and cursor movement. &quot;Sticky&quot; or &quot;latching&quot; keys are used to enter multiple key sequences, i.e. Alt F to open a file.<br>
<br>
The BAT is a keyboard, it is not a mouse. However, all cursor movements can be achieved and with Windows 95 and System 7 for Macintosh users can turn the keypad into a mouse. If a pointing device is desired, most users mount a portable Glidepoint touchpad (available from Infogrip) just above the thumb keys or place a trackball or mouse on the low side of the BAT, thereby minimizing hand movement.<br>
<br>
Users can do anything on the BAT keyboard that they would with an extended keyboard and more.<br>

CarpalRest Document Holders<br>
It is finally here, a document holder that will fit all of your needs and store in a limited space.<br>
There are 2 basic sizes with 3 angle settings and 3 styles of lips.<br>
If none of these units fit the bill, we can custom build to your requirements.<br>
The folding lip collapses so the document holder is only 1 1/2 thick, allowing<br>
 easy storage.<br>
The surface is a durable, non-glare smooth surface perfect for writing on.<br>
The tall lip holds larger binders and books.<br>

                            Reduces or eliminates the grip force required to navigate and click traditional mice.  This ergonomically sculpted mouse is designed to support your hand comfortably without the need to clutch the mouse to control it. Four right hand sizes and three left hand sizes properly fit your hand so you are not trying to navigate a mouse that is too small for your hand. You escape the habit of pinching a small mouse on the sides while curling your fingertips back to click on the buttons.  Excessive clutching and finger flexing can aggravate the carpal tunnel and result in repetitive strain injuries such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Tendonitis.<br>
<br>
A pronounced hump on the top of the mouse supports the bones in your hand from underneath, just like an orthopedic arch in a well constructed athletic shoe. The specially designed arch fills the hollow of your palm and allows you to rest your hand on top of the mouse.  This arch promotes straight alignment of your hand and wrist bones and slightly elevates your wrist off of the working surface.  This helps to break the harmful habit of resting your wrist on the desk or mouse pad and pivoting the mouse from side to side.  That pivoting can cause pain and discomfort as the forearm bones (radius and ulna) twist in directions not easily tolerated by human physiology.<br>
<br>
Elongated buttons allow you to use the second knuckle of your finger to activate clicks, which uses a stronger, thicker tendon. On smaller, conventional mice, most users pull their fingertips back in order to activate the mouse buttons.  The Contour Mouse allows you to rest your hand on top of the mouse and activate the buttons with small, subtle motions without flexing your fingers.  Please view the product video on this web page for a more detailed visual demonstration of this advantage. The elimination of flexing reduces carpal tunnel use and the threat of repetitive strain injuries.<br>
<br>
Customize your mouse with your choice of Black or White color, Right or Left handed, with or without a scroll wheel, available in four different sizes. There is a Contour Mouse that is right for you and your work habits as well as your hand size.  One size doesnt fit all in shoe sizes and hand sizes are similar.<br>
<br>
Convenient, out of the box, plug and play connectivity for both PC and Mac computers.  This HID compliant device has the drivers on board and simply needs to be plugged into any empty USB port, without the need for a cumbersome connection routine.<br>
<br>
Powerful scientific research went in before the product went out.  The owner of Contour Design worked with ten CAD/CAM engineers who suffered with carpal tunnel pain in a lab for eighteen months to develop the current Contour Mouse design.  They evolved through 120 different molds before they were satisfied.  The final design allowed the injured engineers to work for eight hours without pain.<br>
<br>
17 degree pronation angle relieves pressure on the forearm bones while still minimizing grip force. The design team considered more vertical designs in the development phase, but found that more grip force was required in order to activate the buttons.  They found that a 17 degree angle relative to the working surface to be the right balance, relieving pressure from crossing the forearm bones caused by true palm down devices.<br>

                            Roller Mouse - Eliminates reaching for a traditional mouse, relieving neck, shoulder and elbow pain. Asymmetrical reaching with one side of your body and not the other causes your muscle groups to compensate for the weight of your extended arm while reaching for a traditional mouse. Repetitive reaching oftentimes leads to tightness and pain in the neck, shoulder and elbow areas. The RollerMouse Free allows you to keep your elbows comfortably by your side, which is a more beneficial ergonomic position. Thousands of users have thanked us due to the pain relief they have realized after using the RollerMouse for a short period of time. Please review the testimonials linked to this page for their direct feedback.<br>
<br>
There is no gripping necessary, thus avoiding the threat of Repetitive Strain Injuries such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Tendonitis. The RollerMouse Free is controlled with the use of an unflexed hand, so there is no need to clutch or hold the device in order to navigate the cursor. Your fingertips roll a narrow bar both up and down and from side to side simultaneously to navigate the cursor over the entire screen, with very little friction or resistance. The elimination of flexing your fingers avoids activity through the carpal tunnel, overuse of a traditional mouse can aggravate the carpal tunnel and lead to numbness, tingling and pain.<br>
<br>
Promotes the equal use of both hands, reducing the risk of injuring your dominant mousing hand. With the mouse buttons centered beneath the keyboard home keys, mouse control is equidistant from either hand. Ambidextrous use is encouraged and easily accomplished with your command buttons literally at your fingertips, for both hands.<br>

                            STOP PAIN  REDUCE PAIN<br>
<br>
Enjoy the ease, comfort and powerful functional capabilities of this revolutionary medical imaging device.  The Rx Shuttle Pro was developed with the collaboration of a prominent Radiologist at Mass General Hospital in Boston.  As the number of images became greater per case, the arduous task of scanning through images for diagnostic review started to cause the Radiologist pain while using a traditional mouse.<br>
<br>
The ultimate solution became the 15 button, jog wheel centric Rx Shuttle Pro.  This device works with popular PACS software packages to enable Radiologists to review cases with increased speed and reduced pain.<br>
<br>
Eliminates Grip Force.<br>
The Rx Shuttle Pro uses a central jog wheel with seven forward and seven reverse speeds.  This makes image viewing easy and painless.  Hundreds or Thousands of images can be scanned within a minute, without clutching and dragging a traditional mouse.  This elimination of constantly gripping a traditional mouse allows for greater productivity and comfort.  Within the jog wheel is a frame by frame advance wheel that increases the accuracy of reviewing specific images for review.<br>
<br>
Robust 15 Function button array reduces reaching and typing.<br>
The Rx Shuttle Pro has fifteen programmable buttons to handle the most frequently used functions performed by the Radiologist.  These buttons have custom programmable capabilities, or can be set to match the functional mapping included with popular PACS software programs.  Regardless of the source, single button activations replace multiple keystroke and function key clicks, reducing reaching and fatigue.<br>
<br>
Compatible with most popular PACS software drivers.<br>
The Rx Shuttle Pro is compatible with PACS software drivers from G.E., Phillips, McKesson and AGFA.  We offer these drivers as accessories that can be purchased along with the Rx Shuttle Pro unit.  The CD ROM containing the desired drivers will be placed inside the box with the original shipment.  These popular function sets make diagnosis and imaging navigation a breeze.<br>
<br>
Plug and Play convenience on both Windows and Apple operating systems.<br>
The RX Shuttle Pro works both with PC based and Mac based operating systems with ease.  Simply plug the USB connector into any available port and the device operates automatically.<br>

                            Evoluent LLC is the inventor of the handshake grip<br>
The Evoluent Vertical Mouse 3 is the advanced third generation of the revolutionary<br>
mouse that amazingly relieved wrist and arm pain - according to many user reports<br>
The shape has been further refined in subtle details based on the<br>
ergonomic lessons learned from the previous two generations<br>
Eliminates arm twisting<br>
The patented shape supports your hand in a fully upright handshake position that eliminates forearm twisting.<br>
Many users said earlier models relieved their hand, wrist, or arm pain<br>
An ordinary horizontal mouse requires your forearm to twist away from its natural position<br>
Familiar grip<br>
The grip is the same as an ordinary mouse, just turned sideways<br>
Most users said they got used to it very quickly<br>
The VerticalMouse does not move sideways when clicking with normal force because the thumb naturally opposes the fingers<br>
Pointer control is as accurate as any other good mouse when the pointer speed settings are properly adjusted<br>
Easy to use buttons ALL 5 buttons are easily operable without contorting your fingers<br>
The button force is light for easy clicking, but still firm enough to avoid accidental actuation<br>
Special Features - XPP and Vista only<br>
Speed toggle - cycle among up to 3 pointer speed settings by keyboard shortcut or mouse button - For example, a high speed for ordinary tasks, and a slow speed for graphics work<br>
Auto click - automatically perform a single or double click by pausing the pointer. Adjustable time delay for activation<br>
Click lock - press and hold a button momentarily to simulate continued pressing without holding down the button. Adjustable time delay for activation.<br>
Break Reminder - visual and/or audio alerts to remind you to take a break.<br>

                            Polymer Footrest - Make Workstations Comfortable!<br>
Help your back feel better with our new quality constructed solid polymerfootrest.<br>
It promotes proper posture thus making you more comfortable.<br>
Available either Grey or Black this attractive and long lasting solid polymer footrest features a special high-friction surface that is environmentallystabilized to resist harsh sun light including ultraviolet light.<br>
The surface has a dot pattern texture that inhibits slippage.<br>
It is not a laminated surface, but instead it is a single homogeneous polymer sheet that will not rot, swell, or delaminate when exposed to sun or moisture.<br>
Our solid polymer footrest providesa practical ergonomic solution for workstations that require cleaning or disinfecting.<br>
The footrest is chemically resistant and most common detergents and cleansers work well to remove soil.<br>
Bleach can be applied and allowed to soak to help lift persistent stains.<br>
To clean a petroleum based stains such as grease or oil, use citrus cleaner, alcohol, or mineral spirits.<br>
Furniture polish or products such as Armor-All can add an attractive luster to the finish and hide small mars on the product&#39;s surface.<br>
However, the use of such polishing agents reduces the coefficient of surface adhesion.  <br>

CarpalRest Document Holders - 24&quot; x 12&quot;<br>
It is finally here, a document holder that will fit all of your needs and store in a limited space.<br>
There are 2 basic sizes with 3 angle settings and 3 styles of lips.<br>
If none of these units fit the bill, we can custom build to your requirements.<br>
The folding lip collapses so the document holder is only 1 1/2 thick, allowing<br>
easy storage.<br>
The surface is a durable, non-glare smooth surface perfect for writing on.<br>
 The tall lip holds larger binders and books.<br>

A tiny single-button mouse with no scroll wheel, thats easy to control and made of rugged plastic for strength and durability.<br>

The XTAG Wireless Microphone clips on your shirt or hangs around your neck with no annoying transmitter or battery pack. It provides superb audio performance while allowing you to move around the room as you talk to your MAC!<br>
<br>
XTAG moves the microphone close to your mouth, so it eliminates most background noise and allows the software to hear every word! It uses 128-bit encryption so that your conversations are secure. xTag can be recharged in 2 hours for 8 hours of talk time, and if crunched for time, it can recharged to 80% capacity in less than an hour.<br>

                            Microphone - Voice Tracker Array<br>
The Voice Tracker Array microphone has been Certified by Dragon and ViaVoice speech recognition software, HomeSeer and HAL Home Automation software, and unlike first generation array microphones which have a fixed &quot;listen&quot; direction, the Acoustic Magic Voice Tracker Array Microphone automatically locates and electronically steers toward the talker<br>
Used in speech recognition, meeting and transcription recording, VoIP and conventional teleconferencing, voice control for home automation, and security surveillance.<br>
The Voice Tracker Array Microphone is unique in the market place because it has eight microphone elements that scan 360 degrees continuously<br>
This allows the Voice Tracker to locate a talker from ranges of 20&#39; or more<br>
The microphone elements electronically steer a listening beam, like an acoustic searchlight, in the direction of the talker in a few milliseconds<br>
Spatial filtering, so sounds from other parts of the room are not picked up<br>
In addition, the Voice Tracker removes stationary background noise with digital noise reduction algorithms <br>

<br>
ScannaR is not only great for the home or office. It is an ideal tool for educators and students at all levels for quickly scanning and recording textbooks, worksheets, tests and exams. Because of its audio output as well as the bonus ability to download files to a BrailleNote or VoiceNote, it is suitable for environments where resources are shared among students who either have low vision or are blind.<br>
<br>
How does ScannaR work?<br>
Simply place a document on the scanner, press a button, and ScannaR will read the text in natural sounding speech. If you want to save your document, press and speak a filename into the built-in microphone.<br>

The history of Basic<br>
Basic Blue Bar was developed in 1988 and 1989 as part of our first generation modern braille embossers. It came in two models, classic and advanced. The small, light and efficient Basic was received well by our customers, which spurred further development.<br>
<br>
In 1995 Basic V2 was introduced. It looked like Basic does today, a well known and much liked design. With V2 there was a choice between single- or double sided embossing.<br>
<br>
In 2003 Basic V3 took the next step forward. All modern Basic embossers use the latest Braille technology, including double sided embossing, USB and Network support.<br>

                            Flexi Paper, tactile paper<br>
Flexi-Paper - Flexible - Durable - Portable - Error Free<br>
These are the properties that make Flexi - Paper Tactile<br>
Imaging Paper the most unique product ever developed for the production of tactile images<br>
Flexi-Paper is imaged by drawing upon it with a soft lead pencil or printing on it with an HP InkJet printer. <br>
Then passed through the TIE and Tactile documents are created.<br>
Flexi-Paper documents are so durable that they can be folded, even crumbled into a ball and the tactile image will NOT be distorted. <br>
Of equal importance the paper will not crease. <br>
A crease has the potential of transmitting false information as a distorted tactile image.<br>

                            BackTpack - The Healthy Way to Carry<br>
        BackTpack was designed by a physical therapist as a remedy for the poor posture and pain associated with everyday backpack use such as school, travel, and commuting. Better than a backpack, BackTpacks ergonomic side bag system applies a balanced load onto the vertical spinal axis, prompting you to stand straight and tall. With good posture, your bones, muscles, and all the systems of the body work in harmony with gravity the foundation of fitness and injury prevention.<br>
        Common backpacks require you to lean forward to compensate for the load on the back. This posture leads to back, neck and shoulder pain. BackTpack allows you to stand, walk, and sit with your spine and head tall and your shoulders relaxed in a healthy posture. No more twisting and bending to access items.<br>
        Training these postural habits will contribute to lifelong healthy movement and a strong skeleton. The load feels much lighter, and when applied in this manner becomes your friend not your burden, encouraging your body to be strong, upright, graceful and free.<br>
        Note: All bags are free of latex or natural rubber.<br>
<br>
    BackTPack Belt for Hip Loading - Included<br>
        One size fits all.<br>
        Adjustable web belt for hip loading option.<br>
        Size: One inch wide nylon webbing<br>
        Adjustable in length: 29&quot; - 54&quot; | 73.7 - 137.2 cm<br>
        Color: Black<br>
    BackTpack and the Laws of Physics<br>
        Unlike backpacks or messenger bags, BackTpack, with its balanced side bags, applies the load to the bodys vertical axis, thereby eliminating posture distortion and decreasing the effort required to carry the load, in obedience to the laws of physics. The load feels lighter and you stand straighter.<br>
            The center of gravity:<br>
                When we support a weight, we have a new center of gravity -- the combination of our body&#39;s center of gravity plus the center of gravity of the weight we are supporting. When what we carry is balanced left-right or front-back, or is on top of the head, its center of gravity aligns vertically with ours.<br>
                However, if the weight is off-axis (in front, to one side, or behind), we must lean away from the load to keep our new center of gravity over our feet so that we don&#39;t fall.  Posture must change to accommodate the bag we carry, and the heavier the load, the more we must lean.<br>
            The line of force:<br>
                The force applied to support the load must go through the center of gravity of the load.  So again, when the load is balanced, or on our head, the supporting force is simply equal to the weight we carry, and in the opposite direction: straight up!<br>
                When the weight is off-axis, we must pull in a direction such that the direction of the pull goes through the center of gravity of the load.  This introduces a horizontal component to the force, which is added to the weight, meaning that more force is required.  Put another way, a heavy backpack requires you to lean forward and pull forward with your shoulders.  This is why you see hunched shoulders and forward heads with backpack use.  With the same load in a BackTpack, you eliminate the forward pull.<br>

                It is also the reason that people say, &quot;The load feels lighter!&quot; when they try on a BackTpack loaded with the contents of their conventional backpack.<br>
            Adjustable shoulder straps<br>
                Padded for comfort<br>
                Secured in place by an adjustable sternum strap, so they never fall off your shoulders<br>
            Adjustable SIT-STRAP<br>
                This unique feature is essential for spinal health. Since you should not apply a load to a flexed spine (as when seated), the SIT-STRAP transfers the weight immediately off the shoulders and spine to the thighs without removing shoulder straps<br>
                The bags will remain accessible at our sides if you choose to remove shoulder straps<br>
            Padded bottoms and side panels against your body<br>
                For durability and comfort<br>

    Who can Penfriend benefit?<br>
    Physical Disabilities<br>
        Penfriend is the ideal tool to help people with Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Stroke, limb deformities and any condition where the physical effort of typing is difficult.<br>
        It speeds up writing by cutting down the number of keystrokes needed to write a document. The only comparison (Ch 14 p 164) between predictors we know of showed that Penfriend saved more keystrokes than any other program.<br>
        The on-screen keyboard may be the only means of writing using a mouse controlled by hand, head or foot<br>
        Abbreviation expansion speeds the typing of common phrases or text such as one&#39;s address.<br>
        Switch access provided through other programs such as the integration with Clicker enables to severely physically handicapped to write.<br>
    Word prediction<br>
        Word prediction is very valuable for those with dyslexia where recognising a correctly spelt word offered by the predictor is easier than thinking how to spell it in the first place.<br>
        Better spelling, grammar, thesaurus, dictionaries<br>
        Better spelling and grammar helps many but particularly those with dyslexia. Knowing that Penfriend provides correctly spelt words gives greater confidence.<br>
        The access provided by Penfriend XL to Microsoft Word&#39;s spell checking, thesaurus, dictionaries and translation is of great help to any with dyslexia.<br>
    Speech Feedback and Screen Reading<br>
        Another benefit of Penfriend for those with dyslexia is it&#39;s speech feedback and in Penfriend XL its screen reading features.<br>
        Being able to hear each letter, word or sentence vocalized as you type is of very obvious value to those with dyslexia, but Penfriend also allows you to highlight a block of text or an entire document and have it read back to you. This not only allows dyslexic people to understand the contents of a document they may not be able to read, but also helps them to associate the sound of a word with how it looks on the page.<br>
    On-screen keyboard<br>
        Penfriend&#39;s on-screen keyboard reduces the strain of glancing between screen and keyboard, a valuable tool for the dyslexic using a computer.<br>
        Faster writing of longer tasks for those with<br>
    Visual Impairment<br>
        One can change the font size in Penfriend to make it easier for those with poor sight to see the predictions and controls in Penfriend.<br>
        When screen reading, open the clipboard in a convenient position, then everything read appears in the clipboard at the same position on the screen and in the font size being used in Penfriend.<br>
    Speed<br>
        Penfriend saves key-strokes by typing letters for you. This helps writers to get more on paper in the same time, and to write more before they get tired.<br>
        In a detailed academic study of supportive writing software by the CALL Centre, Penfriend was found to be the most effective word predictor. It saved around 65% of keystrokes (more than any other product), and predicted the correct word by the time the first letter had been typed in around 70% of cases (again, the best).<br>
    Screen Reading<br>
        Penfriend XL comes with a screen reading and text magnification facility, just click on the folders on your desktop or read web pages and hear them read with native voices. Speak the list of words offered by your word processor&#39;s thesaurus or spell checker.<br>
        The spoken text is transferred automatically to the clipboard where, if a large font is used, it can be magnified for those with visual impairment. There is an icon in the clipboard which allows you to switch the screen reading on and off at a single click.<br>
        The speech feedback facility in both Penfriend XP and XL means that it also speaks back the text you are writing. It can be configured to speak each letter as it is typed, each word as it is completed, and each sentence. It can read words from the prediction list when you point at them, when you choose them, or automatically when they change. It can also read back whole paragraphs (or more) of text from other applications using the clipboard. This might be your document, a web page, an email, or almost anything else.<br>
        While speaking text from the clipboard, a window can be shown which follows the voice, highlighting each word as it goes. You can click on a word to hear it again, or to speak a fragment of the text. This can be used in conjunction with the screen reading to enlarge and highlight words being read from web pages or the desktop.<br>
    Spell checking, Thesaurus and Dictionary<br>
        The screen reader in Penfriend XL makes it possible to read and highlight alternative spellings, synonyms and dictionary meanings available in Microsoft Word. These can all be read out, and if necessary magnified,on a right click.Thus although it does not have a spell checker built in, it gives direct access to the excellent Spell Checking, Thesaurus and Dictionary available in MS Word.<br>
    Lexicon Editing and Topic Lexicons<br>
    Lexicon Editing<br>
        Penfriend doesn&#39;t claim to know all the words you want to write in advance, but it is very good at learning them. Every word you type is analysed, and Penfriend can learn those it doesn&#39;t recognise. Depending on your spelling, you might ask for new words to be predicted immediately (as appropriate), or perhaps just to be remembered and then checked by a teacher.<br>
    Lexicon Editing<br>
        Another feature is the ability to ban words. Thus risqué words, or words that a child should be able to spell can be banned, so that they are never predicted.<br>
        Penfriend holds new words in a specially marked list, so that you can easily review the ones it has learnt recently. There are various tools for manipulating these, such as approving only those used several times. This is also a useful tool for a teacher to see the spelling errors that a child is making.<br>
        As well as learning new words, Penfriend keeps track of the ones you&#39;ve used, and your style of writing. This all helps to predict the right words next time!<br>
    Topic Lexicons<br>
        Often you want specific vocabulary for a particular topic. One of the major advantages of Penfriend is that it is very easy to teach it new words either from the clipboard or a text file. Thus if you have a document with the words you want to use in it, it takes seconds to teach the program these words. They can then either be kept for the future or used for that one session. It is your choice.<br>
    Word Prediction - Prediction Window<br>
        Penfriend word prediction software suggests words, as you type text into your preferred word processor or text editor.<br>
        Penfriend XP can predict the next word you want to write in English and Penfriend XL can do so in many languages.<br>
        Penfriend is very good at guessing the word you are typing after you have entered one or two initial letters. One key press, or one mouse click on your chosen word in the prediction window, then completes the word for you.<br>
        Penfriend will then go on to predict the next complete word you want to type and it is almost always very successful in doing so. It is in fact possible to write an entire document simply by clicking on Penfriend&#39;s suggested words in the prediction window, after typing in only the first few letters.<br>
        One user commented that &quot;This software is spookily good at prediction&quot;.<br>
        Penfriend&#39;s word prediction uses a dictionary of known words, along with detailed knowledge of when they are likely to be used and words you have used before. Every time you type a letter, it comes up with a new list of the most likely words which fit your letters. Choosing one is a simple matter of pressing one more button, or clicking on the word with the mouse. If you&#39;re not sure how to read it, you can hear it spoken before you choose a word. This is valuable for those who have physical disabilities or dyslexia. But it will also help those wanting to write in a language that they are learning.<br>
        Minimising the predictor window switches off prediction and all the assistive functions in Penfriend. Useful if you want to type an email address without spaces after the full stop, or type numbers whilst predicting using number keys.<br>
<br>
    On-screen Keyboard<br>
        Penfriend XL comes with keyboards for many languages where their colour and size and font size can be adjusted to suit the user. Anyone can type easily in a foreign language.<br>
        On-Screen Keyboard<br>
        The on-screen keyboards in both the XP (English only) and XL (multi-language) versions of Penfriend will be particularly useful for people either with physical disabilities affecting their use of a keyboard, or for those with dyslexia by reducing the visual strain of glancing repeatedly between the screen and keyboard.<br>
        It is also useful to anyone wanting to type in a language that is different from the default language on the users computer. Typing French on a computer set up for use in the UK or German on a computer set up for use in France becomes simple with Penfriend XL&#39;s keyboards.<br>
        There are now additional characters such as Â,[,],@,# available via the Alt key. And the English keyboard now has the accented characters used in Gaelic.<br>

    TAP-it: Creating a Custom Fit for Success<br>
        Finding assistive technology that serves the needs of multiple individuals with a variety of special needs is challenging.<br>
        Meet Bre, a bright and witty 9-year-old with congenital limb deficiencies and an extraordinary sense of courage and determination.<br>
        Whether she is using her motorized wheelchair or modeling her new prosthetic legs, the Touch Accessible<br>
    Platform for Interactive Technology (TAP-it)<br>
        Accommodates her individual needs with its wide base, tilt angles, and height adjustment capabilities.<br>
        TAP-it uses Intended Touch technology, which means it recognizes the difference between purposeful and accidental interactions with the screen.<br>
        Any software used on a computer can easily be used on this touch-sensitive platform.<br>
    The TAP-it interactive workstation responds to a variety of stylists, including:<br>
        Pointers<br>
        Mouth Sticks<br>
        Head Pointers<br>
        Switches/Scanners<br>
        Balls<br>
        On-Screen Keyboards<br>
    Serving a wide range of students special needs, TAP-it provides multiple modes of learning to accommodate tactile, visual and auditory learners, as well as those with:<br>
        Traumatic Brain Injury<br>
        Down Syndrome<br>
        Intellectual Disabilities<br>
        Autism Spectrum Disorder<br>
        Cerebral Palsy<br>
        Spinal Cord Injuries<br>
        ADD &amp; ADHD<br>
        Learning Disabilities<br>
        Vision &amp; Hearing Disabilities<br>
        Sensory Processing Disorders<br>
        Muscular Dystrophy<br>
    TAP-it truly helps lay the groundwork for success. The customizable design allows students like Bre to focus on what matters most: their education.<br>
    Accessibility -<br>
        TAP-it provides a touch accessible interactive learning platform that supports shared occupational therapy and academic goals to become a transformative classroom tool for students and educators.<br>
        It minimizes barriers and maximizes flexibility by adapting to the individual needs of students.<br>
    Fine Motor Delays <br>
        Students can operate the screen using a finger, assistive device, or reach stick.<br>
        Larger icons help them select the correct target to make their choices.<br>
        The work area is designed to ensure that the majority of students are able to reach the entire surface.<br>
    Involuntary Arm Movements <br>
        Students can use the interface to press the large virtual icons.<br>
        This helps to accommodate their lack of precision and accuracy in directing the mouse pointer.<br>
    Visually Impaired <br>
        TAP-it works with any software on your computer allowing teachers, students and parents to resize text and graphics, adjust brightness or contrast controls, and enlarge images or change background colors within seconds.<br>
        The low-glare, matte finish display is shadow-free, providing optimal viewing for low-vision users.<br>
    Hearing Impaired <br>
        Finger-touch input keeps hands free of pen tools that interfere with signing. Interactive media keeps students engaged.<br>
        They can read from the board and sign at the same time, increasing opportunities for communication between teachers and students.<br>
    Developmental Delays <br>
        TAP-it offers ongoing visual reinforcement to complement lessons and improve functional capabilities.<br>
        While their eye movement increases, students with ASD, ADD, etc, can track content with greater ease.<br>
        The physical interaction and visual stimulus offers an additional sensory channel to help process information.<br>
    Applications <br>
        Any software, switch or website you currently use works with TAP-it.<br>
        Use Boardmaker, Starfall or News2you for read out loud Speech/Language activities.<br>
        Occupational therapists can practice cause and effect, eye tracking, and extended reach capabilities with gaming software and websites. Zoomtext is a favorite among teachers who work with the visually challenged.<br>
        Every teacher has a preference, and if you use it on your computer, you can use it on TAPit.<br>
    Warranty <br>
        TAP-it is protected by a three-year parts and labor warranty.<br>

                            Saddle and Pony Saddle Seats<br>
Saddle and Pony Saddle seats, part of Humanscales award-winning Freedom seating line, are the most comfortable and versatile stools ever made. The original Saddle and the more compact Pony Saddle accommodate comfortable seating in countless applications. These stools encourage you to sit in a saddle posture, which lowers the thighs, opens up the hips and puts the spine into a healthy lordotic curve. The stools are ideal for shorter term sittingor even for getting your feet up off the ground by using it as an ottoman.<br>

Oyster Mouse is an ergonomic mouse with 5 repositionable mouse angles and is suitable for both left-handed and right-handed users. <br>
<br>
The Oyster Mouse is an award winning design by Ergoption that is the only fully adjustable ergonomic mouse: you can instantly adjust the mouse to 5 different angles to intuitively find the best posture for you.

<br>
The Oyster Mouse Wireless is perfectly ambidextrous allowing an equally comfortable computing experience for both right and left hand users. This feature makes it ideal for companies that sup-ply their employees with mice. There is no guessing, or asking, what kind they need. <br>
<br>
The Oyster Mouse Wireless is winner of the 2011 National Ergonomics Conference and Exposition Attendees Choice Award. <br>

Cloud-Based Multilingual Solution<br>
ReadSpeaker Enterprise Highlighting consists of a Listen button and an integrated fully keyboard-controllable audio player. In our latest release, we have updated our player to the latest web standards (HTML5/CSS3), requiring fewer images and no Flash, while making the design and functionality more user-friendly. We also offer several ways for you to easily customize our player to better match the design of your website. ReadSpeaker Enterprise Highlighting works on all devices and browsers, even the latest iOS and Android devices. <br>
<br>
The Web-Reading Experience<br>
When your user clicks the Listen button, ReadSpeaker Enterprise Highlighting opens our player and starts reading the content of the page. The text is also highlighted while it is being read, reinforcing a better understanding of the text. The settings menu enables your users to customize the reading experience. They can control the reading speed and how the text is highlighted, either sentence by sentence or word by word. They can select text to only listen to certain parts of the page. They can also choose to have the page scroll automatically to follow the highlighted text. <br>

              My name is Ann Miller. I am a retired lady with multiple disabilities and I am a client of Special Needs Computers.<br>
<br>
I have nothing but praise for the care and honesty, as well as the dedication of Terry Scott and his team. My computer is wonderful! It was set up, all programs installed, in the time requested by me. <br>
<br>
I was truly impressed by the promises kept, the training provided and most of all, my specific needs met. All this was accomplished with my financial restrictions in mind. <br>
I am still in the process of learning all the different software and hardware that was recommended as I am not very computer literate, at least, not yet! I am sure that by the time my training is complete I will be totally comfortable with my system. The whole process has been a great experience for me.<br>
<br>
In closing, I would not hesitate to recommend Special Needs Computers to anyone, especially those of us who have Special Needs. <br>
<br>

I found Terrys (computer needs) assessment of my disabilities to be right on. His listening skills were wonderful and his ability to purchase software for my business was excellent. The assistive devices he purchased for me have been a great help and because of them I am able to work a few more hours each day. This is an accomplishment in itself. <br>
<br>
Terrys personality is non-threatening and a person you can invite into your home. Terry has a unique was of putting computer jargon into laymans terms. He always returns phone calls or emails promptly. I would recommend Terrys work to anyone. Karen Mitchinson.<br>

Hi, my name is Mark Furness. I have dealt with several ADP Vendors over a 10-year period. Many times, my friends have asked me for advice in what to look for in a computer system. It is with personal experience and great sincerity I state that no other vendor has provided such an excellent system as Terry Scott from<br>
