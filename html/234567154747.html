                            At LASIK PROVISION we offer a variety of Lasik Procedures to correct eye and vision problems. We have skilled doctors and a professional medical team to ensure the safety and success of your Lasik procedures.<br>
<br>
PRK (PHOTOREFRACTIVE KERATECTOMY)<br>
PRK is generally recommended for patients whose corneas are too thin to allow for the creation of the LASIK flap safely. PRK is a refractive surgery in which the central epithelium, or surface layer of the cornea, is removed by the surgeon, and then the corneal bed is directly reshaped with the laser.<br>
<br>
The surgeon may choose to use an anti-inflammatory compound Mitomycin C on some patients. Mitomycin C is a powerful pharmaceutical agent which inhibits haze in patients post PRK. It is highly recommended to use Mitomycin C on all patients with greater than -4.00 D prescriptions who are having PRK since these patients are at greater risk of the complication of haze formation post operatively.<br>
<br>
To promote healing and comfort, a bandage contact lens is placed on the cornea. The corneal epithelium will heal within 5-6 days in the average patient. During this period, it is recommended that you are monitored daily by our optometrists or your eye care professional until the contact lens is removed.<br>
<br>
After the contact lens is removed, the follow-ups are usually more spaced out. Because there is no flap created, restrictions with physical activities are less than what is imposed upon LASIK patients.<br>
<br>
Myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism can be treated using PRK. Again, presbyopia cannot be corrected by excimer laser treatments.<br>
<br>
If you are having PRK, it probably means your corneas are thinner than average, your prescription is higher or both.<br>
<br>
ICL (IMPLANTABLE CONTACT LENS)<br>
ICL IMPLANTABLE CONTACT LENS procedure can be offered to patients who have high myopia or hyperopia that are not candidates for LASIK or PRK. Dr. Taylor uses the Collamer ICLTM, which is an implantable lens, similar to a contact lens. The ICL is placed inside the eye instead of on the cornea (the surface of the eye). The lens is soft and thin like your natural lens, but does not replace it. It therefore does not cause you to lose the natural accommodative reading power of your natural lens. The Collamer ICL produces highly accurate visual correction without removing tissue from your eye, or interfering with your central optical axis. It is completely reversible.<br>
<br>
CLE (CLEAR LENS EXTRACTION)<br>
The CLE Clear Lens Extraction Lasik procedure is usually offered to patients who are very farsighted and who are presbyopic and are not candidates for LASIK or ICL. The procedure is the same as a cataract extraction, except there is no cataract to remove. The clear lens inside the eye is removed surgically and replaced with an intra-ocular lens that corrects the refractive error of the eye. Multiple styles of intra-ocular lenses are now available that offer patients the option of obtaining multifocal vision for distance and near and wavefront correction for higher order aberrations.<br>
<br>
PUNCTUAL PLUGS<br>
The tears drain into the nose via drainage ducts known as Puncta. Through these, your tears, or additional lubricating drops, can escape while your glands are making new ones. In each of your eyes, on the eyelid margin in the corner towards your nose, there is one punctum in the top eyelid and another on the bottom eyelid. About 80% of the tears drain from the lower, 20% from the upper puncta.<br>
<br>
People with dry eyes don’t have enough tears on the eye, either because they don’t produce enough, or they don’t stay long enough on the eye. Punctal plugs do exactly what they sound like: they stop the drains, just like the plug in your kitchen sink. This allows the tears that you do produce to stay on the eye for a longer time period. This increases comfort and lowers the frequency of artificial tear use in dry eye patients.<br>
<br>
The punctual plugs can be inserted in either of the lower or upper eyelids or both. Two types are available; temporary punctual occlusion can be achieved with collagen implants which eventually dissolve after 2 weeks. These are beneficial in ascertaining whether punctal blockage will help reduce dry eye symptoms. Longterm punctal occlusion can then be achieved by using silicone plugs. These are umbrella shaped with the top part of the plug resting on the eyelid surface. Silicone plugs can be removed if necessary or can remain in the eyelid for a prolonged period of time, unless they fall out.<br>
<br>
BLENDED VISION<br>
Blended Vision - A New Answer for Presbyopia<br>
<br>
What is PRESBYOPIA? <br>
As people get older, the lens inside their eye changes and is no longer able to focus the eye on images up close. This condition is called presbyopia. People with this condition may experience eye fatigue when reading in poor light or at the end of the day, have trouble changing their focus from distance to near, or need to constantly change the position of reading materials to find the right focus. This loss of elasticity in the lens becomes evident when near vision starts to get blurry somewhere between the ages of 40 to 50. Nobody is immune from this condition, and unchecked certainly means wearing reading glasses, bifocals or progressives.<br>
<br>
What Are the Symptoms of Presbyopia?<br>
<br>
Symptoms of presbyopia include:<br>
<br>
Blurred vision at a normal reading distance.<br>
The need to hold reading material at arm&#39;s length.<br>
Headaches from doing close work.<br>
Presbyopia can be corrected by wearing reading glasses. Some people have avoided reading glasses for many years, however, through a technique called monovision contact lenses and now blended vision.<br>
<br>
What is Monovision?<br>
<br>
Monovision is an option for people with presbyopia where the two eyes are adjusted to have slightly different focusing points. One eye will see things close up, the other eye will see things farther away, and the brain will incorporate the visual information from both and filter out any blur. With monovision, the brain usually adjusts within 6-8 weeks to each eye focusing at a different distances. Refractive surgery patients can attain monovision with laser vision correction. The procedure uses a method called blended vision a type of monovision that most people have found easier to adjust to.<br>
<br>
How Does Laser Blended Vision Work?<br>
<br>
Blended Vision is a LASIK procedure where the excimer laser makes one eye (non-dominant eye) a little nearsighted. Your dominant eye then sees clearly in the distance and the non-dominant eye sees near.<br>
<br>
Laser Blended Vision is not just making the non-dominant eye near sighted as monovision. The laser also creates a positive spherical aberration in the center of the eye. This correction makes the image disparity from the two eyes smaller and the brain blends the images together even better that you will not notice which eye you are looking through for distance or near.<br>
<br>
Both eyes are usually treated to ensure the best possible balance of vision. The laser reshapes the surface of the cornea just as it is done in conventional laser eye surgery. During conventional laser eye surgery the laser reshapes the cornea so that the power is the same throughout the whole cornea. This is not the case for blended vision as the laser creates different power zones so that parts of the cornea are corrected for distance vision and the other parts for reading vision.<br>
<br>
Now is an excellent time to consider blended vision since Lasik Provision has acquired the Zeiss MEL 80 Excimer Laser which is suited for blended vision treatments. Before proceeding with the procedure you will need to be tested to see whether you can see far and near by correcting the dominant eye for the distance and the non-dominant eye for reading. If you can tolerate this disparity in the correction then you will be considered for the procedure. <br>
<br>
Laser Blended Vision can be performed on those who had LASIK done before and also on those using readers only to reduce the need to wear reading glasses.<br>
<br>
HAIR REMOVAL is a more effective solution. The LightSheer™ Diode laser is a state-of-the-art system specially designed to remove unwanted hair faster, with less discomfort and more reliably than other methods.<br>
<br>
About LightSheer™ laser treatment&lt;<br>
A laser produces a beam of highly concentrated light. The light emitted by the LightSheer™ diode laser is well absorbed by the pigment located in hair follicles. During the procedure, the laser pulses for a fraction of a second, long enough to heat up the hair and significantly impede the follicle’s ability to re-grow. This process also treats numerous hair follicles simultaneously. Therefore, LightSheer™ is appropriate for treating even the largest areas of the body both quickly and effectively.<br>
<br>
An important part of the procedure is the cooling of the skin. A special contact-cooling hand piece allows your physician to treat even the most sensitive skin. It protects and cools the upper layer of the skin before, during and after each laser pulse while directing the laser energy to the hair root.<br>
<br>
What can you expect?<br>
The length of a laser treatment may last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more, depending on the size of the area being treated. It is important to know that the hairs in an active growth phase (referred to as anagen) are most affected by the laser. As all hairs are not in this phase at the same time, more than one treatment will be necessary to achieve the best result.<br>
<br>
Hair’s active growth phase is called anagen. During anagen, the hair contains an abundance of melanin. Hairs in this phase are most affected by treatment. Catagen is the regression phase when the lower part of the hair stops growing but is not shed, and the follicle is reabsorbed. The resting phase is called telogen, during which the old hair falls in preparation for the development of new hair.<br>
<br>
The laser treatment itself may cause some discomfort. Most patients tolerate the procedure well, but because some areas of the body are more sensitive than others, topical anesthesia can be an option.<br>
<br>
The appearance of the treated area immediately following treatment will vary from patient to patient depending on the extent of the procedure and skin type. Side effects, if any are minor. They may include redness and swelling around the hair follicle, which are, in fact, desired clinical results and indicate that the follicle has responded to the treatment. Most people return to normal activity right away. We will be happy to tell you more about your treatment, possible side effects and what results you can expect during your consultation.<br>

                            At LASIK PROVISION we offer a variety of Lasik Procedures to correct eye and vision problems. We have skilled doctors and a professional medical team to ensure the safety and success of your Lasik procedures.<br>
<br>
PRK (PHOTOREFRACTIVE KERATECTOMY)<br>
PRK is generally recommended for patients whose corneas are too thin to allow for the creation of the LASIK flap safely. PRK is a refractive surgery in which the central epithelium, or surface layer of the cornea, is removed by the surgeon, and then the corneal bed is directly reshaped with the laser.<br>
<br>
The surgeon may choose to use an anti-inflammatory compound Mitomycin C on some patients. Mitomycin C is a powerful pharmaceutical agent which inhibits haze in patients post PRK. It is highly recommended to use Mitomycin C on all patients with greater than -4.00 D prescriptions who are having PRK since these patients are at greater risk of the complication of haze formation post operatively.<br>
<br>
To promote healing and comfort, a bandage contact lens is placed on the cornea. The corneal epithelium will heal within 5-6 days in the average patient. During this period, it is recommended that you are monitored daily by our optometrists or your eye care professional until the contact lens is removed.<br>
<br>
After the contact lens is removed, the follow-ups are usually more spaced out. Because there is no flap created, restrictions with physical activities are less than what is imposed upon LASIK patients.<br>
<br>
Myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism can be treated using PRK. Again, presbyopia cannot be corrected by excimer laser treatments.<br>
<br>
If you are having PRK, it probably means your corneas are thinner than average, your prescription is higher or both.<br>
<br>
ICL (IMPLANTABLE CONTACT LENS)<br>
ICL IMPLANTABLE CONTACT LENS procedure can be offered to patients who have high myopia or hyperopia that are not candidates for LASIK or PRK. Dr. Taylor uses the Collamer ICLTM, which is an implantable lens, similar to a contact lens. The ICL is placed inside the eye instead of on the cornea (the surface of the eye). The lens is soft and thin like your natural lens, but does not replace it. It therefore does not cause you to lose the natural accommodative reading power of your natural lens. The Collamer ICL produces highly accurate visual correction without removing tissue from your eye, or interfering with your central optical axis. It is completely reversible.<br>
<br>
CLE (CLEAR LENS EXTRACTION)<br>
The CLE Clear Lens Extraction Lasik procedure is usually offered to patients who are very farsighted and who are presbyopic and are not candidates for LASIK or ICL. The procedure is the same as a cataract extraction, except there is no cataract to remove. The clear lens inside the eye is removed surgically and replaced with an intra-ocular lens that corrects the refractive error of the eye. Multiple styles of intra-ocular lenses are now available that offer patients the option of obtaining multifocal vision for distance and near and wavefront correction for higher order aberrations.<br>
<br>
PUNCTUAL PLUGS<br>
The tears drain into the nose via drainage ducts known as Puncta. Through these, your tears, or additional lubricating drops, can escape while your glands are making new ones. In each of your eyes, on the eyelid margin in the corner towards your nose, there is one punctum in the top eyelid and another on the bottom eyelid. About 80% of the tears drain from the lower, 20% from the upper puncta.<br>
<br>
People with dry eyes don’t have enough tears on the eye, either because they don’t produce enough, or they don’t stay long enough on the eye. Punctal plugs do exactly what they sound like: they stop the drains, just like the plug in your kitchen sink. This allows the tears that you do produce to stay on the eye for a longer time period. This increases comfort and lowers the frequency of artificial tear use in dry eye patients.<br>
<br>
The punctual plugs can be inserted in either of the lower or upper eyelids or both. Two types are available; temporary punctual occlusion can be achieved with collagen implants which eventually dissolve after 2 weeks. These are beneficial in ascertaining whether punctal blockage will help reduce dry eye symptoms. Longterm punctal occlusion can then be achieved by using silicone plugs. These are umbrella shaped with the top part of the plug resting on the eyelid surface. Silicone plugs can be removed if necessary or can remain in the eyelid for a prolonged period of time, unless they fall out.<br>
<br>
BLENDED VISION<br>
Blended Vision - A New Answer for Presbyopia<br>
<br>
What is PRESBYOPIA? <br>
As people get older, the lens inside their eye changes and is no longer able to focus the eye on images up close. This condition is called presbyopia. People with this condition may experience eye fatigue when reading in poor light or at the end of the day, have trouble changing their focus from distance to near, or need to constantly change the position of reading materials to find the right focus. This loss of elasticity in the lens becomes evident when near vision starts to get blurry somewhere between the ages of 40 to 50. Nobody is immune from this condition, and unchecked certainly means wearing reading glasses, bifocals or progressives.<br>
<br>
What Are the Symptoms of Presbyopia?<br>
<br>
Symptoms of presbyopia include:<br>
<br>
Blurred vision at a normal reading distance.<br>
The need to hold reading material at arm&#39;s length.<br>
Headaches from doing close work.<br>
Presbyopia can be corrected by wearing reading glasses. Some people have avoided reading glasses for many years, however, through a technique called monovision contact lenses and now blended vision.<br>
<br>
What is Monovision?<br>
<br>
Monovision is an option for people with presbyopia where the two eyes are adjusted to have slightly different focusing points. One eye will see things close up, the other eye will see things farther away, and the brain will incorporate the visual information from both and filter out any blur. With monovision, the brain usually adjusts within 6-8 weeks to each eye focusing at a different distances. Refractive surgery patients can attain monovision with laser vision correction. The procedure uses a method called blended vision a type of monovision that most people have found easier to adjust to.<br>
<br>
How Does Laser Blended Vision Work?<br>
<br>
Blended Vision is a LASIK procedure where the excimer laser makes one eye (non-dominant eye) a little nearsighted. Your dominant eye then sees clearly in the distance and the non-dominant eye sees near.<br>
<br>
Laser Blended Vision is not just making the non-dominant eye near sighted as monovision. The laser also creates a positive spherical aberration in the center of the eye. This correction makes the image disparity from the two eyes smaller and the brain blends the images together even better that you will not notice which eye you are looking through for distance or near.<br>
<br>
Both eyes are usually treated to ensure the best possible balance of vision. The laser reshapes the surface of the cornea just as it is done in conventional laser eye surgery. During conventional laser eye surgery the laser reshapes the cornea so that the power is the same throughout the whole cornea. This is not the case for blended vision as the laser creates different power zones so that parts of the cornea are corrected for distance vision and the other parts for reading vision.<br>
<br>
Now is an excellent time to consider blended vision since Lasik Provision has acquired the Zeiss MEL 80 Excimer Laser which is suited for blended vision treatments. Before proceeding with the procedure you will need to be tested to see whether you can see far and near by correcting the dominant eye for the distance and the non-dominant eye for reading. If you can tolerate this disparity in the correction then you will be considered for the procedure. <br>
<br>
Laser Blended Vision can be performed on those who had LASIK done before and also on those using readers only to reduce the need to wear reading glasses.<br>
<br>
HAIR REMOVAL is a more effective solution. The LightSheer™ Diode laser is a state-of-the-art system specially designed to remove unwanted hair faster, with less discomfort and more reliably than other methods.<br>
<br>
About LightSheer™ laser treatment&lt;<br>
A laser produces a beam of highly concentrated light. The light emitted by the LightSheer™ diode laser is well absorbed by the pigment located in hair follicles. During the procedure, the laser pulses for a fraction of a second, long enough to heat up the hair and significantly impede the follicle’s ability to re-grow. This process also treats numerous hair follicles simultaneously. Therefore, LightSheer™ is appropriate for treating even the largest areas of the body both quickly and effectively.<br>
<br>
An important part of the procedure is the cooling of the skin. A special contact-cooling hand piece allows your physician to treat even the most sensitive skin. It protects and cools the upper layer of the skin before, during and after each laser pulse while directing the laser energy to the hair root.<br>
<br>
What can you expect?<br>
The length of a laser treatment may last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more, depending on the size of the area being treated. It is important to know that the hairs in an active growth phase (referred to as anagen) are most affected by the laser. As all hairs are not in this phase at the same time, more than one treatment will be necessary to achieve the best result.<br>
<br>
Hair’s active growth phase is called anagen. During anagen, the hair contains an abundance of melanin. Hairs in this phase are most affected by treatment. Catagen is the regression phase when the lower part of the hair stops growing but is not shed, and the follicle is reabsorbed. The resting phase is called telogen, during which the old hair falls in preparation for the development of new hair.<br>
<br>
The laser treatment itself may cause some discomfort. Most patients tolerate the procedure well, but because some areas of the body are more sensitive than others, topical anesthesia can be an option.<br>
<br>
The appearance of the treated area immediately following treatment will vary from patient to patient depending on the extent of the procedure and skin type. Side effects, if any are minor. They may include redness and swelling around the hair follicle, which are, in fact, desired clinical results and indicate that the follicle has responded to the treatment. Most people return to normal activity right away. We will be happy to tell you more about your treatment, possible side effects and what results you can expect during your consultation.<br>
