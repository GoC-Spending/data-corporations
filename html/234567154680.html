Therefore the approach to internet marketing is not a single strategy “magic bullet” but rather a whole plethora of strategies and tactics tailor made to your Toronto business.But wait, didn’t you just say that a website is not enough? It’s true that that a great website is no longer enough – but it is still essential. Your business website should do a number of things for your business. First, it should be search engine optimized (SEO), so that it will have a higher ranking in the search engines. Remember, it doesn’t matter how nice your website looks if it doesn’t have traffic.<br>
<br>
Second, it should provide a good visitor experience. If it is easy for your visitors to read, navigate and locate information, they will be more likely to linger.<br>
<br>
Finally, a website should have a clear call to action. Whether the goal of your website is to sell a product, get subscribers or have potential customers visit you in person, you need a website that entices your visitors to do those things.<br>

                            PPC, or Pay–Per–Click, is a model used to direct traffic to your website through advertisements on other relevant sites and directories. PPC campaigns usually require meticulous and consistent monitoring and management due to the many factors involved, such as click–through rate and quality score; mismanagement can lead to ineffective ads as well as misuse of the budget that results in a money drain. However, with proper management, PPC can be a very effective model in providing a steady influx of potential customers interested in your product or service, as well as increasing the online exposure of your company.<br>

                            Google, the world’s largest search engine, utilizes Google Places as a deciding factor in their organic search results. While theoretically this allows legitimate businesses to thrive in the online community, the sheer amount of scamming and noise involved has made it difficult for proper businesses to show up in results—creating a need for professional Google Places optimization. In Toronto, a vibrant and crowded marketplace, proper Google Places optimization is crucial to both increasing the exposure of your business, as well as proving its legitimacy to potential customers.<br>

                            The internet marketing domain is constantly changing. Social media marketing is no exception. How can this type of marketing improve business, and what exactly is Social Media Marketing? Toronto has a number of Internet Marketing companies claiming to have the answer, however few of them have the resources and the infrastructure to offer solutions to the cities vibrant clientele.There are a number of companies who offer user-friendly platforms to manage your needs for social media marketing. Toronto, just like any city has its own trends, social culture, and other nuances that make “one fit all solutions” ineffective. Toronto for example, has a very culturally diverse population, it is a very trend-aware city, with high use of internet technology and social media. Marketing throughout Toronto, however also requires the knowledge of ethnic communities specific to industries, and townships. A marketing platform, made overseas or in the United States would simply not work.<br>

                            Website conversion optimization is the process of improving the way visitors interact with your website through optimizing visual elements by rearranging, enhancing or emphasizing certain visual elements to establish or improve visual hierarchy. Website conversion optimization, when properly utilized, leads customers through a designated and established path to maximize the chances of success—by whatever metrics that success is measured. This can either be as simple as successfully transmitting information to the visitor, to something more complex such as booking an appointment or making a purchase. Through rearranging and adding or eliminating visual elements, the process increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the website—making it a more pleasant experience for the user, who is then more likely to recognize the company as a viable solution to whatever they are looking for.<br>

                            As the use of smartphones and tablets becomes more widespread, having a mobile website designed specifically to aid your potential and existing clients access information is becoming a necessity. The steady increase of mobile device usage for Internet access means that the mobile version of your website holds equal importance to the desktop version—and that both websites should have functions that befits the characteristics of the device used. Google is predicting that the number of mobile searches will supersede the number of desktop searches by 2014—sector by sector, companies are adjusting their Internet presence to reflect this trend and make sure that mobile website design is an integral part of their overall strategy.<br>

Proper implementation of mobile advertisements or promotions can help brand awareness and increase consumer traffic, as well as raise conversion rates and create brand equity.

                            98% of visitors of a website will leave without making a purchase on their initial visit, meaning only 2% of customers convert right away. Remarketing and retargeting are techniques that will remind potential customers of your presence and entice them to return at a later date, all while building brand awareness for your company.<br>
<br>
Remarketing often involves emails and tailored or customized offers to your customers based on their browsing history or previous purchases—this allows the costumer to be reminded of the benefits of your product or service, as well as giving your company an opportunity to promote new products or services that will entice the costumer to return to your website.<br>
Retargeting is the process of showing ads to users who have previously visited your website, but likely left without making a purchase. Since most customers of a website are there to browse for information and options, they are not likely to make an immediate purchase. This results in a large portion of the audience that needs to be reminded of your presence throughout their Internet browsing, in order to keep your company relevant and included in their future purchase decision.<br>

                            In its simplest terms, e-commerce is the buying and selling of goods or services over the internet. And if you think that online shopping is something that only a select tech-savvy few are doing, then think again. A recent study by Deloitte showed that by 2016, global online sales are expected to reach a whopping $1.4 trillion. That’s an increase of 12% since 2012.<br>

Therefore the approach to internet marketing is not a single strategy “magic bullet” but rather a whole plethora of strategies and tactics tailor made to your Toronto business.But wait, didn’t you just say that a website is not enough? It’s true that that a great website is no longer enough – but it is still essential. Your business website should do a number of things for your business. First, it should be search engine optimized (SEO), so that it will have a higher ranking in the search engines. Remember, it doesn’t matter how nice your website looks if it doesn’t have traffic.<br>
<br>
Second, it should provide a good visitor experience. If it is easy for your visitors to read, navigate and locate information, they will be more likely to linger.<br>
<br>
Finally, a website should have a clear call to action. Whether the goal of your website is to sell a product, get subscribers or have potential customers visit you in person, you need a website that entices your visitors to do those things.<br>

PPC campaigns usually require meticulous and consistent monitoring and management due to the many factors involved, such as click–through rate and quality score; mismanagement can lead to ineffective ads as well as misuse of the budget that results in a money drain. However, with proper management, PPC can be a very effective model in providing a steady influx of potential customers interested in your product or service, as well as increasing the online exposure of your company.<br>

                            Google, the world’s largest search engine, utilizes Google Places as a deciding factor in their organic search results. While theoretically this allows legitimate businesses to thrive in the online community, the sheer amount of scamming and noise involved has made it difficult for proper businesses to show up in results—creating a need for professional Google Places optimization. In Toronto, a vibrant and crowded marketplace, proper Google Places optimization is crucial to both increasing the exposure of your business, as well as proving its legitimacy to potential customers.<br>

                            The internet marketing domain is constantly changing. Social media marketing is no exception. How can this type of marketing improve business, and what exactly is Social Media Marketing? Toronto has a number of Internet Marketing companies claiming to have the answer, however few of them have the resources and the infrastructure to offer solutions to the cities vibrant clientele.There are a number of companies who offer user-friendly platforms to manage your needs for social media marketing. Toronto, just like any city has its own trends, social culture, and other nuances that make “one fit all solutions” ineffective. Toronto for example, has a very culturally diverse population, it is a very trend-aware city, with high use of internet technology and social media. Marketing throughout Toronto, however also requires the knowledge of ethnic communities specific to industries, and townships. A marketing platform, made overseas or in the United States would simply not work.<br>

                            Website conversion optimization is the process of improving the way visitors interact with your website through optimizing visual elements by rearranging, enhancing or emphasizing certain visual elements to establish or improve visual hierarchy. Website conversion optimization, when properly utilized, leads customers through a designated and established path to maximize the chances of success—by whatever metrics that success is measured. This can either be as simple as successfully transmitting information to the visitor, to something more complex such as booking an appointment or making a purchase. Through rearranging and adding or eliminating visual elements, the process increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the website—making it a more pleasant experience for the user, who is then more likely to recognize the company as a viable solution to whatever they are looking for.<br>

                            As the use of smartphones and tablets becomes more widespread, having a mobile website designed specifically to aid your potential and existing clients access information is becoming a necessity. The steady increase of mobile device usage for Internet access means that the mobile version of your website holds equal importance to the desktop version—and that both websites should have functions that befits the characteristics of the device used. Google is predicting that the number of mobile searches will supersede the number of desktop searches by 2014—sector by sector, companies are adjusting their Internet presence to reflect this trend and make sure that mobile website design is an integral part of their overall strategy.<br>
<br>
Whether it is through application based advertisements or mobile search engine results, mobile advertising is rapidly becoming an accessible and viable marketing option for many companies. Proper implementation of mobile advertisements or promotions can help brand awareness and increase consumer traffic, as well as raise conversion rates and create brand equity. Nova Solutions is committed to integrating mobile web design and advertising for Toronto companies through our dedicated and experienced mobile web design staff.<br>

                            98% of visitors of a website will leave without making a purchase on their initial visit, meaning only 2% of customers convert right away. Remarketing and retargeting are techniques that will remind potential customers of your presence and entice them to return at a later date, all while building brand awareness for your company.<br>
<br>
Remarketing often involves emails and tailored or customized offers to your customers based on their browsing history or previous purchases—this allows the costumer to be reminded of the benefits of your product or service, as well as giving your company an opportunity to promote new products or services that will entice the costumer to return to your website.<br>
Retargeting is the process of showing ads to users who have previously visited your website, but likely left without making a purchase. Since most customers of a website are there to browse for information and options, they are not likely to make an immediate purchase. This results in a large portion of the audience that needs to be reminded of your presence throughout their Internet browsing, in order to keep your company relevant and included in their future purchase decision.<br>

                            In its simplest terms, e-commerce is the buying and selling of goods or services over the internet. And if you think that online shopping is something that only a select tech-savvy few are doing, then think again. A recent study by Deloitte showed that by 2016, global online sales are expected to reach a whopping $1.4 trillion. That’s an increase of 12% since 2012.<br>
