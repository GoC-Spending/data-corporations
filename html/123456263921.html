            Tire Lyna is a registered trademark of Lyna Manufacturing Incorporated. Tire Lyna is a high quality product, scientifically researched, cost effective alternative to competing tire maintenance programs currently on the market. Developed by professionals for professionals and backed by several years of extensive scientific research and field testing. Tire Lyna exhibits a number of properties not always found in tire maintenance products currently available on the market. These include the fact that it is stable and homogeneous i.e. spreads evenly without settling or separating. It is easily washed out of the casing with water and contains only non-toxic and environmentally-friendly materials (both of which are important for the recapping process). Tire Lyna is conveniently packaged in 5 gallon pails/640ozs and will treat 10 to15 truck/bus (11R 22.5) tires depending on retread grade and make (Asian). Optional application pump is made of high quality aircraft grade aluminum. Once installed, the gel is activated by the tire&#39;s normal dynamics, including centrifugal force and heat generated by friction between the tire and road surface and forms a thin protective gel coating over the inner liner, which protects the casing from heat damage and oxidation.<br>
The product is designed to manage air porosity and can operate between -80F to +370F. Its sealant properties stops bead leaks and &quot;O&quot; ring leaks and seals punctures (up to 1/2&quot;) in the tread area. The product is specifically designed to reduce the number of casings that end up in the landfills. Tire Lyna maintains air pressure, lowers fuel costs, reduces tire-operating temperature, and significantly reduces tire maintenance costs. It seals punctures while the wheel is in motion, reduces costly downtime, employee down time, frustrations with tires and does not have an effect on the tire manufacturers casing warranty. One treatment is guaranteed to last for the full legal tread life of the tire.<br>
The product is commercially proven and tested with real world customers and endorsements. <br>
<br>
All formulations are 100% environmentally safe, non-toxic and are MSDS classified as &quot;Not Controlled&quot;.<br>

Current available options are:<br>
Tire thumping, Tire Pressure Monitors, Nitrogen Tire Inflators, Air Pressure Maintenance &amp; Transfer System and Tire Maintenance Programs.<br>
<br>
Tire thumping is the worst available option. Do you thump the engine to check your oil level?<br>
Tire pressure monitors only monitor tire pressure and therefore tires still have to be filled with air.<br>
Nitrogen Tire Inflation System has a hefty upfront cost and if a tire gets a road side flat then there usually is no roadside service for Nitrogen. Therefore the tire filled with compressed air will overheat more then the Nitrogen filled tire, which will result in an uneven wear.<br>
Air Pressure Maintenance &amp; Transfer System works well however it is expensive to purchase and requires a lot of maintenance on hardware. It will transfer air from a separate tank or use air from the air brake reservoir.<br>
Tire Maintenance Program is either a tire thumping program or it requires a full time person in charge of checking tire pressures on a daily basis. It does get challenging when your trailers are away for a long time. <br>
<br>
The most preferred option is:<br>
Tire Lyna is fast becoming one of the most sought after products for proactive trucking fleets and heavy equipment owners who are exploring &quot;Green&quot; products for sustainability issues and are constantly looking for ways to lowering operational expenses, fuel expense, equipment and tire downtime. The most frequent comments that we receive is Tire Lyna is making a huge impact with our employees not waiting for a simple tire service call and it is saving us countless hours in tire pressure checks, bead leaks, flat repairs, fuel and downtime costs. <br>

&quot;We have been running a fleet of Skid Steer Loaders for over 10 years. Over the years we have tried numerous products pumped into our tires to &quot;Stop Leaks&quot;. Three and half years ago we began using Tire Lyna. Our downtime due to flat tires has decreased remarkably.&quot;<br>
John Coombs, General Manager<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the major concerns to everyone who retreads tires is the quality of the casing and the ability for the casing to undergo standard inspection procedures. The decision to accept a tire for retreading is the decision to put a company&#39;s name on the final product. We tested Tire Lyna in one of our trucks for a period of four months and during the inspection stage we noticed it had sealed two nail punctures. Tire Lyna will not cause chamber fires; it is easily washes out and has passed our retread process.&quot;<br>

&quot;We have been using Tire Lyna with great success in our repair facility at United Rentals Langley BC since 1999. As you know the construction industry uses many different types of fasteners, which get dropped or lost on different job sites. Tire Lyna has helped reduce the service calls due to slow leaks caused by small punctures in tires. It has also increased our customer loyalty on the rental side.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;I have used Tire Lyna, and prior to that, similar products for the last 30-35 years. Tire Lyna, in my opinion is the best of all the products I have used. It has sealed the most consistently, stays in place as it was designed to do and is easy to work around. My opinion is based on the use of the product as an air-loss preventative. This is my opinion, and not an expression on behalf of my company.&quot;<br>

&quot;Late last year we were introduced to another tire sealant brand that was supposed to be just as good as Tire Lyna but for less money. We get some pretty cold winters (-20 to -40 is not unusual) the other product froze solid in one of our tires at -20 while the Tire Lyna treated tires just kept on rolling without any issues ( it recently hit -37 here, no problems at all with the Tire Lyna treated tires) the other brand was a bit less expensive initially it ended up costing us a whole lot more money and time than Tire Lyna.&quot;<br>
Mike Richards<br>
<br>
&quot;I had tried every brand of sealer out there and did not work. We had so many plugs in the tires. I was searching the web and found Tire Lyna, call them and got a pail of their Tire Lyna. We dismounted all tires and cleaned them so there was no sealer in them. We installed Tire Lyna in the tires; we have had not one flat on the ATV’s since we installed Tire Lyna. We have saved on down time and overtime.<br>
It’s the best thing we have done to decrease our overhead.&quot;<br>

&quot;I was losing air from a bead leak and from a nail in one of my rigs tires (you could actually hear the air coming out) I remembered the product from the show and skeptical as I was I gave them a call as I figured I had nothing to lose except the cost to treat one tire (which turned out be $30.00, which is a hell of a lot less than a roadside tire repair!) They came out and treated the tire. I drove 15 - 20 ft forward and 15 - 20ft backward. Air leak gone. The next day at the end of my run I checked the tire that had been treated, no air pressure loss and much to my surprise the treated tire was cooler to the touch than the untreated tire beside it. Thank you Tire Lyna...&quot;<br>

&quot;We all know the importance of staying ahead of the first few groups in the morning allowing us to perform our tasks with minimal disruptions by our members. After out fitting all our turf grass equipment with Tire Lyna we have reduced our flat tires from an average of 14 per season to zero last year. This has not only reduced our equipment &amp; employee down time it has reduced our labor &amp; frustration.&quot;<br>

&quot;I have been operating skid steers for many years and always carried &quot;plug kits&quot; for on - site repairs. Now that I have Tire Lyna my down time is non-existent and productivity increased. The extra money in my pocket is a real bonus.&quot;<br>

&quot;After many months of talking to tire maintenance managers at several mines, one manager at became interested in trying Tire Lyna in order to protect his casings on his 240 MT haul trucks against heat damage. They have 26 haul trucks in that location. Belongs to GRUPO MEXICO, a very large company with mining operations in Mexico, Peru, Chile, USA, and other countries. After 15 days, the tire maintenance manager Raul was surprised to find out that the tires with Tire Lyna did not heat as much as the ones that did not have Tire Lyna. His deduction came from the charts that he prepared, and that we attach (next slide). He acknowledges that the coolest the tires operate, the longer they will live. Also, Raul mentioned that when he completes his evaluation, he expects to incorporate Tire Lyna as a stocking product at the mine, in order to use it in all their off road and mining tires.&quot;<br>

Hi Noorez,<br>
<br>
Work is starting to pick up, and I apologize for not getting back to you yet, but it went well! I still had an issue with air leaking from one tire, but I believe it’s my issue and not the sealant. It had a slow leak, but I just aired it up between heats and it held well enough.<br>
<br>
I put a couple of videos up on YouTube from our last race:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46C-xTAxXks<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-vHTN-t-nM<br>
<br>
Overall, I’m very impressed with the sealant! My ice tires have nearly 4000 drilled holes in them, partially plugged by screws, and only one hole generated a slow leak. I actually found a pre-drilled hole in one of my tires where I forgot to put a screw in, and that tire doesn’t leak at all. I’ll break the tire down and put a screw in it too, but that’s a good indicator of how well Tire Lyna works. I also have a group of off-road truck guys already interested in Tire Lyna. Slime helps a lot of off-road racers down south, but since it doesn’t work in freezing temps our local guys don’t even use it, but they’re looking for something that works. So far, other than my extra drilled holes in the tires, Tire Lyna is working great!<br>

On July 5th 2012 we installed Tire Lyna into a 26.5R29 tire on one of our skid steer loaders. The tire was completely &quot;ringed&quot; with sidewall cracks/splits. The sidewall cracks/splits ranged in length from 2 to 11 inches and some were over an inch deep. We had to add air on a daily basis and looking back on it, the tire should have been replaced. A year later and counting the tire is still in service and has not lost one single pound of air!<br>
During this time no new splits have occurred and the existing ones have not become worse and we are continuously loading with this vehicle. The product really works.<br>
<br>
Noorez,<br>
I love the product and have seen it work with my own eyes. I would have NO issues backing up this product. I was sold when I could not get the beads on a 355/55D625 to seal. Pumped in the product, laid the tire/wheel assembly on either side for mere seconds. When I introduced the air, the product slightly blew out where the air was escaping then sealed instantly. I have never been called back to repair or air up that tire again. Make me the go to guy here in the GTA and I&#39;ll have no problem being your distributor. I could have truck delivering it full time.<br>

<br>
tire-lyna is the most effective product of its type<br>
i used it in my skid steer tires during a teardown of an old building<br>
i put the recommended amount in each tire<br>
initially we intended to keep track of nails in the tires but after a few days it was too many<br>
every morning we pulled out numerous nails varying in size from #3 to 30 (these are nearly 1/4 &quot; in diameter)<br>
The teardown and reconstruction is now over and the tires are still on the machine and the tires are still at 55 pounds preasure<br>
It has been 9 months<br>
Nearly as good as foam filling the tires<br>

After a year and a half of testing the Armada product in a variety of applications as well as wheel positions, I have found it exceeded our expectations.<br>
We started by using the product in 255/70R225 trailer tires ( 50 oz per wheel ) The air pressure was maintained , driver comments were the trailer pulled better with less vibration.<br>
We next installed the product in more trailer tires with same results.<br>
To determine what effect ARMADA had on wheel balance we started to install the product in steer tires .We took a couple of ways to test the effects on balancing .<br>
First we would balance the tires by conventional method of spinning tire and adding wheel weights, the truck would go into service for a few days to determine if there was any vibration or ride issue. The truck would then come back and we would remove the wheel weights and install Armada in each tire ( 11R225 &amp; 11R2245 60 oz per tire ) Ride and driver feed back was all positive with some drivers reporting improve in ride &amp;handling when Armada was installed.<br>
The scope of the testing was as follows<br>
ATV / Lawn &amp; Garden - Maintain air pressure as well a s reduce flat tires<br>
Implement - Maintain air pressure<br>
Travel Trailer/ Motor Home – Reduced blow outs due to low air pressure ( less damage to units ) Improved ride for trailer and motorhomes as product balanced the tires ranging from 225/75R16 up to 295/75R225<br>
OTR / Farm – Maintained air pressure ( stopped rim leaks as well as leaks pertaining to punctures )<br>
Medium Truck – Balancing on trucks &amp; trailers( less cupping in trailer application ) , maintained air pressure as well improved ride I drive and steer positions.<br>
We are very please with the Armada and will continue to use it in all applications.<br>
Thanks again<br>

Hello Marcel,<br>
I hope this letter finds you well. I just wanted to pass along my thanks for introducing our fleet to the Tire Lyna product. Our service runs a range of units from sedans, pickups, SUV&#39;s and Medium Duty Transports and we have tried your product across the board. The single most important key factor for us was the immediate elimination of flat tires in units equipped with Tire Lyna. I cannot express the importance of not having a flat. This product has far exceeded our expectations and is simpler to use than other run flat technologies that we have tried and at a much lower price point per unit. We have also experienced an increase in tire life and heat reduction, specifically on our larger medium duty fleet.<br>

Hi Noorez, Just wanted to thank you for the excellent service you have given us. We were very impressed how well your Tire Lyna gel worked for us. The Tire Protection alone, along with all the other safety benefits sure made us feel more secure with our tires. We had no tire balancing problems and our tires were running cooler. Your product did not interfere with our TPMS concern about pressure readings. Thank you for no more flats. Your product is excellent for all types of tires and it being biodegradable makes it even more appealing to all our customers. We love the fact that it is considered a green product. We recently did some cars, golf carts, electric scooters and trucks with our customers. We have some very happy customers now, since we solved their problems. Our dealers prefer selling the product as a fix the air leak instead of fix flats because more people have leaky tires than flats. We look forward to a long and continued business relationship.<br>

I have completed the cure test for the Tire Lyna/Tire Medic product you have been using with your fleet in Florida. The test was conducted at Bingham Tire &amp; Retreading (Goodyear Authorized Retreader). The product passed without any incident including up to 300 degrees and the standard 260 degree cure as well. Further more, there was no residue or damage to anything either in the tires or any equipment during the entire retread process. I left 5 ounces of product in 23 tires (usually tires are cleaned and washed out) and not only did it not ignite in the cure process but it dried and evaporated the remaining sealant from inside the tire. This product is retread friendly. It also washes out with water too!<br>
<br>
I hope this information helps,. This is the only sealant that I have tested that does not create a chamber fire!!!!<br>

Re: Tire Medic/Tire Lyna<br>
Bingham Tire &amp; Retreading has been retreading as a Goodyear Authorized Retreader since 2002. I have tried other tire sealants in the past that have made claims that their product is retreadable only to find out that they fail during the chamber cure process. We have tested the Tire Medic brand product through a full scale cure (at 260 degrees) successfully. The Tire Medic sealant did not cause a chamber fire and I would recommend this sealant to any customer looking to operate their fleet or equipment with the Tire Medic brand product. This is the only product that has proven itself through the retread process. I have to also mention that many sealants are hard to clean out of the tire. Your product easily washes right out of the tire with water. No pressure washer or cleaning agent of any kind is needed at all. Tire Medic is truly the best and most value added product on the market. It seals up to a ½” puncture! It also seals beads to reduce/ eliminate bead leaks. It works with TPMS systems, and to add to this your product is the only lab tested product ARDL (Akron Rubber Developmental Laboratories) on the market. Last but not least, this product lasts the lifetime of the tire! Your product does exactly what you say it does. We now have one product to service everything from a tire on a wheel barrow all the way up to a 63” Off Highway Tire!<br>
Sincerely,<br>

After a year and a half of testing the Armada product in a variety of applications as well as wheel positions, I have found it exceeded our expectations.<br>
We started by using the product in 255/70R225 trailer tires ( 50 oz per wheel ) The air pressure was maintained , driver comments were the trailer pulled better with less vibration.<br>
We next installed the product in more trailer tires with same results.<br>
To determine what effect ARMADA had on wheel balance we started to install the product in steer tires .We took a couple of ways to test the effects on balancing .<br>
First we would balance the tires by conventional method of spinning tire and adding wheel weights, the truck would go into service for a few days to determine if there was any vibration or ride issue. The truck would then come back and we would remove the wheel weights and install Armada in each tire ( 11R225 &amp; 11R2245 60 oz per tire ) Ride and driver feed back was all positive with some drivers reporting improve in ride &amp;handling when Armada was installed.<br>
The scope of the testing was as follows<br>
ATV / Lawn &amp; Garden - Maintain air pressure as well a s reduce flat tires<br>
Implement - Maintain air pressure<br>
Travel Trailer/ Motor Home – Reduced blow outs due to low air pressure ( less damage to units ) Improved ride for trailer and motorhomes as product balanced the tires ranging from 225/75R16 up to 295/75R225<br>
OTR / Farm – Maintained air pressure ( stopped rim leaks as well as leaks pertaining to punctures )<br>
Medium Truck – Balancing on trucks &amp; trailers( less cupping in trailer application ) , maintained air pressure as well improved ride I drive and steer positions.<br>
We are very please with the Armada and will continue to use it in all applications.<br>
Thanks again<br>

Hello Marcel,<br>
I hope this letter finds you well. I just wanted to pass along my thanks for introducing our fleet to the Tire Lyna product. Our service runs a range of units from sedans, pickups, SUV&#39;s and Medium Duty Transports and we have tried your product across the board. The single most important key factor for us was the immediate elimination of flat tires in units equipped with Tire Lyna. I cannot express the importance of not having a flat. This product has far exceeded our expectations and is simpler to use than other run flat technologies that we have tried and at a much lower price point per unit. We have also experienced an increase in tire life and heat reduction, specifically on our larger medium duty fleet.<br>
<br>

Hi Noorez, Just wanted to thank you for the excellent service you have given us. We were very impressed how well your Tire Lyna gel worked for us. The Tire Protection alone, along with all the other safety benefits sure made us feel more secure with our tires. We had no tire balancing problems and our tires were running cooler. Your product did not interfere with our TPMS concern about pressure readings. Thank you for no more flats. Your product is excellent for all types of tires and it being biodegradable makes it even more appealing to all our customers. We love the fact that it is considered a green product. We recently did some cars, golf carts, electric scooters and trucks with our customers. We have some very happy customers now, since we solved their problems. Our dealers prefer selling the product as a fix the air leak instead of fix flats because more people have leaky tires than flats. We look forward to a long and continued business relationship.<br>

I have completed the cure test for the Tire Lyna/Tire Medic product you have been using with your fleet in Florida. The test was conducted at Bingham Tire &amp; Retreading (Goodyear Authorized Retreader). The product passed without any incident including up to 300 degrees and the standard 260 degree cure as well. Further more, there was no residue or damage to anything either in the tires or any equipment during the entire retread process. I left 5 ounces of product in 23 tires (usually tires are cleaned and washed out) and not only did it not ignite in the cure process but it dried and evaporated the remaining sealant from inside the tire. This product is retread friendly. It also washes out with water too!<br>
<br>
I hope this information helps,. This is the only sealant that I have tested that does not create a chamber fire!!!!<br>

Re: Tire Medic/Tire Lyna<br>
Bingham Tire &amp; Retreading has been retreading as a Goodyear Authorized Retreader since 2002. I have tried other tire sealants in the past that have made claims that their product is retreadable only to find out that they fail during the chamber cure process. We have tested the Tire Medic brand product through a full scale cure (at 260 degrees) successfully. The Tire Medic sealant did not cause a chamber fire and I would recommend this sealant to any customer looking to operate their fleet or equipment with the Tire Medic brand product. This is the only product that has proven itself through the retread process. I have to also mention that many sealants are hard to clean out of the tire. Your product easily washes right out of the tire with water. No pressure washer or cleaning agent of any kind is needed at all. Tire Medic is truly the best and most value added product on the market. It seals up to a ½” puncture! It also seals beads to reduce/ eliminate bead leaks. It works with TPMS systems, and to add to this your product is the only lab tested product ARDL (Akron Rubber Developmental Laboratories) on the market. Last but not least, this product lasts the lifetime of the tire! Your product does exactly what you say it does. We now have one product to service everything from a tire on a wheel barrow all the way up to a 63” Off Highway Tire!<br>
Sincerely,<br>

&quot;We have been running a fleet of Skid Steer Loaders for over 10 years. Over the years we have tried numerous products pumped into our tires to &quot;Stop Leaks&quot;. Three and half years ago we began using Tire Lyna. Our downtime due to flat tires has decreased remarkably.&quot;<br>
John Coombs, General Manager<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the major concerns to everyone who retreads tires is the quality of the casing and the ability for the casing to undergo standard inspection procedures. The decision to accept a tire for retreading is the decision to put a company&#39;s name on the final product. We tested Tire Lyna in one of our trucks for a period of four months and during the inspection stage we noticed it had sealed two nail punctures. Tire Lyna will not cause chamber fires; it is easily washes out and has passed our retread process.&quot;<br>

&quot;We have been using Tire Lyna with great success in our repair facility at United Rentals Langley BC since 1999. As you know the construction industry uses many different types of fasteners, which get dropped or lost on different job sites. Tire Lyna has helped reduce the service calls due to slow leaks caused by small punctures in tires. It has also increased our customer loyalty on the rental side.&quot;<br>
Wayne Patterson<br>
United Rentals , District Maintenance Manager<br>
<br>
&quot;I have used Tire Lyna, and prior to that, similar products for the last 30-35 years. Tire Lyna, in my opinion is the best of all the products I have used. It has sealed the most consistently, stays in place as it was designed to do and is easy to work around. My opinion is based on the use of the product as an air-loss preventative. This is my opinion, and not an expression on behalf of my company.&quot;<br>

&quot;Late last year we were introduced to another tire sealant brand that was supposed to be just as good as Tire Lyna but for less money. We get some pretty cold winters (-20 to -40 is not unusual) the other product froze solid in one of our tires at -20 while the Tire Lyna treated tires just kept on rolling without any issues ( it recently hit -37 here, no problems at all with the Tire Lyna treated tires) the other brand was a bit less expensive initially it ended up costing us a whole lot more money and time than Tire Lyna.&quot;<br>
Mike Richards<br>
<br>
&quot;I had tried every brand of sealer out there and did not work. We had so many plugs in the tires. I was searching the web and found Tire Lyna, call them and got a pail of their Tire Lyna. We dismounted all tires and cleaned them so there was no sealer in them. We installed Tire Lyna in the tires; we have had not one flat on the ATV’s since we installed Tire Lyna. We have saved on down time and overtime.<br>
It’s the best thing we have done to decrease our overhead.&quot;<br>

&quot;I was losing air from a bead leak and from a nail in one of my rigs tires (you could actually hear the air coming out) I remembered the product from the show and skeptical as I was I gave them a call as I figured I had nothing to lose except the cost to treat one tire (which turned out be $30.00, which is a hell of a lot less than a roadside tire repair!) They came out and treated the tire. I drove 15 - 20 ft forward and 15 - 20ft backward. Air leak gone. The next day at the end of my run I checked the tire that had been treated, no air pressure loss and much to my surprise the treated tire was cooler to the touch than the untreated tire beside it. Thank you Tire Lyna...&quot;<br>

&quot;We all know the importance of staying ahead of the first few groups in the morning allowing us to perform our tasks with minimal disruptions by our members. After out fitting all our turf grass equipment with Tire Lyna we have reduced our flat tires from an average of 14 per season to zero last year. This has not only reduced our equipment &amp; employee down time it has reduced our labor &amp; frustration.&quot;<br>
Dave Zeiler, Superintendent<br>

&quot;I have been operating skid steers for many years and always carried &quot;plug kits&quot; for on - site repairs. Now that I have Tire Lyna my down time is non-existent and productivity increased. The extra money in my pocket is a real bonus.&quot;<br>

&quot;After many months of talking to tire maintenance managers at several mines, one manager at became interested in trying Tire Lyna in order to protect his casings on his 240 MT haul trucks against heat damage. They have 26 haul trucks in that location. Belongs to GRUPO MEXICO, a very large company with mining operations in Mexico, Peru, Chile, USA, and other countries. After 15 days, the tire maintenance manager Raul was surprised to find out that the tires with Tire Lyna did not heat as much as the ones that did not have Tire Lyna. His deduction came from the charts that he prepared, and that we attach (next slide). He acknowledges that the coolest the tires operate, the longer they will live. Also, Raul mentioned that when he completes his evaluation, he expects to incorporate Tire Lyna as a stocking product at the mine, in order to use it in all their off road and mining tires.&quot;<br>

Hi Noorez,<br>
<br>
Work is starting to pick up, and I apologize for not getting back to you yet, but it went well! I still had an issue with air leaking from one tire, but I believe it’s my issue and not the sealant. It had a slow leak, but I just aired it up between heats and it held well enough.<br>
<br>
I put a couple of videos up on YouTube from our last race:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46C-xTAxXks<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-vHTN-t-nM<br>
<br>
Overall, I’m very impressed with the sealant! My ice tires have nearly 4000 drilled holes in them, partially plugged by screws, and only one hole generated a slow leak. I actually found a pre-drilled hole in one of my tires where I forgot to put a screw in, and that tire doesn’t leak at all. I’ll break the tire down and put a screw in it too, but that’s a good indicator of how well Tire Lyna works. I also have a group of off-road truck guys already interested in Tire Lyna. Slime helps a lot of off-road racers down south, but since it doesn’t work in freezing temps our local guys don’t even use it, but they’re looking for something that works. So far, other than my extra drilled holes in the tires, Tire Lyna is working great!<br>

I contacted Duffield sand and gravel. They have not had any other issues from that tire. They had lost no air; they have had no new splits and were loading continuously with this vehicle, every day until January 15 2014. The tires were replaced then.<br>

On July 5th 2012 we installed Tire Lyna into a 26.5R29 tire on one of our skid steer loaders. The tire was completely &quot;ringed&quot; with sidewall cracks/splits. The sidewall cracks/splits ranged in length from 2 to 11 inches and some were over an inch deep. We had to add air on a daily basis and looking back on it, the tire should have been replaced. A year later and counting the tire is still in service and has not lost one single pound of air!<br>
During this time no new splits have occurred and the existing ones have not become worse and we are continuously loading with this vehicle. The product really works.<br>
<br>
Noorez,<br>
I love the product and have seen it work with my own eyes. I would have NO issues backing up this product. I was sold when I could not get the beads on a 355/55D625 to seal. Pumped in the product, laid the tire/wheel assembly on either side for mere seconds. When I introduced the air, the product slightly blew out where the air was escaping then sealed instantly. I have never been called back to repair or air up that tire again. Make me the go to guy here in the GTA and I&#39;ll have no problem being your distributor. I could have truck delivering it full time.<br>

This review is from: TIRE LYNA 32A4262009 + Instant Tire Repair Gel 32 oz<br>
<br>
tire-lyna is the most effective product of its type<br>
i used it in my skid steer tires during a teardown of an old building<br>
i put the recommended amount in each tire<br>
initially we intended to keep track of nails in the tires but after a few days it was too many<br>
every morning we pulled out numerous nails varying in size from #3 to 30 (these are nearly 1/4 &quot; in diameter)<br>
The teardown and reconstruction is now over and the tires are still on the machine and the tires are still at 55 pounds preasure<br>
It has been 9 months<br>
Nearly as good as foam filling the tires<br>

            Tire Lyna is a registered trademark of Lyna Manufacturing Incorporated. Tire Lyna is a high quality product, scientifically researched, cost effective alternative to competing tire maintenance programs currently on the market. Developed by professionals for professionals and backed by several years of extensive scientific research and field testing. Tire Lyna exhibits a number of properties not always found in tire maintenance products currently available on the market. These include the fact that it is stable and homogeneous i.e. spreads evenly without settling or separating. It is easily washed out of the casing with water and contains only non-toxic and environmentally-friendly materials (both of which are important for the recapping process). Tire Lyna is conveniently packaged in 5 gallon pails/640ozs and will treat 10 to15 truck/bus (11R 22.5) tires depending on retread grade and make (Asian). Optional application pump is made of high quality aircraft grade aluminum. Once installed, the gel is activated by the tire&#39;s normal dynamics, including centrifugal force and heat generated by friction between the tire and road surface and forms a thin protective gel coating over the inner liner, which protects the casing from heat damage and oxidation.<br>
The product is designed to manage air porosity and can operate between -80F to +370F. Its sealant properties stops bead leaks and &quot;O&quot; ring leaks and seals punctures (up to 1/2&quot;) in the tread area. The product is specifically designed to reduce the number of casings that end up in the landfills. Tire Lyna maintains air pressure, lowers fuel costs, reduces tire-operating temperature, and significantly reduces tire maintenance costs. It seals punctures while the wheel is in motion, reduces costly downtime, employee down time, frustrations with tires and does not have an effect on the tire manufacturers casing warranty. One treatment is guaranteed to last for the full legal tread life of the tire.<br>
The product is commercially proven and tested with real world customers and endorsements. <br>
<br>
All formulations are 100% environmentally safe, non-toxic and are MSDS classified as &quot;Not Controlled&quot;.<br>

Current available options are:<br>
Tire thumping, Tire Pressure Monitors, Nitrogen Tire Inflators, Air Pressure Maintenance &amp; Transfer System and Tire Maintenance Programs.<br>
<br>
Tire thumping is the worst available option. Do you thump the engine to check your oil level?<br>
Tire pressure monitors only monitor tire pressure and therefore tires still have to be filled with air.<br>
Nitrogen Tire Inflation System has a hefty upfront cost and if a tire gets a road side flat then there usually is no roadside service for Nitrogen. Therefore the tire filled with compressed air will overheat more then the Nitrogen filled tire, which will result in an uneven wear.<br>
Air Pressure Maintenance &amp; Transfer System works well however it is expensive to purchase and requires a lot of maintenance on hardware. It will transfer air from a separate tank or use air from the air brake reservoir.<br>
Tire Maintenance Program is either a tire thumping program or it requires a full time person in charge of checking tire pressures on a daily basis. It does get challenging when your trailers are away for a long time. <br>

&quot;…We were checking the air pressure on “A” pm and “B” pm checks, we have discovered that the air pressure was so consistent being the right pressure, we only check the air pressure on the “B” pm check.&quot;<br>

&quot;We have been running a fleet of Skid Steer Loaders for over 10 years. Over the years we have tried numerous products pumped into our tires to &quot;Stop Leaks&quot;. Three and half years ago we began using Tire Lyna. Our downtime due to flat tires has decreased remarkably.&quot;<br>
John Coombs, General Manager<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the major concerns to everyone who retreads tires is the quality of the casing and the ability for the casing to undergo standard inspection procedures. The decision to accept a tire for retreading is the decision to put a company&#39;s name on the final product. We tested Tire Lyna in one of our trucks for a period of four months and during the inspection stage we noticed it had sealed two nail punctures. Tire Lyna will not cause chamber fires; it is easily washes out and has passed our retread process.&quot;<br>

&quot;We have been using Tire Lyna with great success in our repair facility at United Rentals Langley BC since 1999. As you know the construction industry uses many different types of fasteners, which get dropped or lost on different job sites. Tire Lyna has helped reduce the service calls due to slow leaks caused by small punctures in tires. It has also increased our customer loyalty on the rental side.&quot;<br>

&quot;I have used Tire Lyna, and prior to that, similar products for the last 30-35 years. Tire Lyna, in my opinion is the best of all the products I have used. It has sealed the most consistently, stays in place as it was designed to do and is easy to work around. My opinion is based on the use of the product as an air-loss preventative. This is my opinion, and not an expression on behalf of my company.&quot;<br>

&quot;Late last year we were introduced to another tire sealant brand that was supposed to be just as good as Tire Lyna but for less money. We get some pretty cold winters (-20 to -40 is not unusual) the other product froze solid in one of our tires at -20 while the Tire Lyna treated tires just kept on rolling without any issues ( it recently hit -37 here, no problems at all with the Tire Lyna treated tires) the other brand was a bit less expensive initially it ended up costing us a whole lot more money and time than Tire Lyna.&quot;<br>

&quot;I had tried every brand of sealer out there and did not work. We had so many plugs in the tires. I was searching the web and found Tire Lyna, call them and got a pail of their Tire Lyna. We dismounted all tires and cleaned them so there was no sealer in them. We installed Tire Lyna in the tires; we have had not one flat on the ATV’s since we installed Tire Lyna. We have saved on down time and overtime.<br>
It’s the best thing we have done to decrease our overhead.&quot;<br>

&quot;I was losing air from a bead leak and from a nail in one of my rigs tires (you could actually hear the air coming out) I remembered the product from the show and skeptical as I was I gave them a call as I figured I had nothing to lose except the cost to treat one tire (which turned out be $30.00, which is a hell of a lot less than a roadside tire repair!) They came out and treated the tire. I drove 15 - 20 ft forward and 15 - 20ft backward. Air leak gone. The next day at the end of my run I checked the tire that had been treated, no air pressure loss and much to my surprise the treated tire was cooler to the touch than the untreated tire beside it. Thank you Tire Lyna...&quot;<br>

&quot;We all know the importance of staying ahead of the first few groups in the morning allowing us to perform our tasks with minimal disruptions by our members. After out fitting all our turf grass equipment with Tire Lyna we have reduced our flat tires from an average of 14 per season to zero last year. This has not only reduced our equipment &amp; employee down time it has reduced our labor &amp; frustration.&quot;<br>
Dave Zeiler, Superintendent<br>

&quot;I have been operating skid steers for many years and always carried &quot;plug kits&quot; for on - site repairs. Now that I have Tire Lyna my down time is non-existent and productivity increased. The extra money in my pocket is a real bonus.&quot;<br>

&quot;After many months of talking to tire maintenance managers at several mines, one manager at became interested in trying Tire Lyna in order to protect his casings on his 240 MT haul trucks against heat damage. They have 26 haul trucks in that location. Belongs to GRUPO MEXICO, a very large company with mining operations in Mexico, Peru, Chile, USA, and other countries. After 15 days, the tire maintenance manager Raul was surprised to find out that the tires with Tire Lyna did not heat as much as the ones that did not have Tire Lyna. His deduction came from the charts that he prepared, and that we attach (next slide). He acknowledges that the coolest the tires operate, the longer they will live. Also, Raul mentioned that when he completes his evaluation, he expects to incorporate Tire Lyna as a stocking product at the mine, in order to use it in all their off road and mining tires.&quot;<br>

Hi Noorez,<br>
<br>
Work is starting to pick up, and I apologize for not getting back to you yet, but it went well! I still had an issue with air leaking from one tire, but I believe it’s my issue and not the sealant. It had a slow leak, but I just aired it up between heats and it held well enough.<br>
<br>
I put a couple of videos up on YouTube from our last race:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46C-xTAxXks<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-vHTN-t-nM<br>
<br>
Overall, I’m very impressed with the sealant! My ice tires have nearly 4000 drilled holes in them, partially plugged by screws, and only one hole generated a slow leak. I actually found a pre-drilled hole in one of my tires where I forgot to put a screw in, and that tire doesn’t leak at all. I’ll break the tire down and put a screw in it too, but that’s a good indicator of how well Tire Lyna works. I also have a group of off-road truck guys already interested in Tire Lyna. Slime helps a lot of off-road racers down south, but since it doesn’t work in freezing temps our local guys don’t even use it, but they’re looking for something that works. So far, other than my extra drilled holes in the tires, Tire Lyna is working great!<br>

I contacted Duffield sand and gravel. They have not had any other issues from that tire. They had lost no air; they have had no new splits and were loading continuously with this vehicle, every day until January 15 2014. The tires were replaced then.<br>

On July 5th 2012 we installed Tire Lyna into a 26.5R29 tire on one of our skid steer loaders. The tire was completely &quot;ringed&quot; with sidewall cracks/splits. The sidewall cracks/splits ranged in length from 2 to 11 inches and some were over an inch deep. We had to add air on a daily basis and looking back on it, the tire should have been replaced. A year later and counting the tire is still in service and has not lost one single pound of air!<br>
During this time no new splits have occurred and the existing ones have not become worse and we are continuously loading with this vehicle. The product really works.<br>
<br>
Noorez,<br>
I love the product and have seen it work with my own eyes. I would have NO issues backing up this product. I was sold when I could not get the beads on a 355/55D625 to seal. Pumped in the product, laid the tire/wheel assembly on either side for mere seconds. When I introduced the air, the product slightly blew out where the air was escaping then sealed instantly. I have never been called back to repair or air up that tire again. Make me the go to guy here in the GTA and I&#39;ll have no problem being your distributor. I could have truck delivering it full time.<br>

<br>
tire-lyna is the most effective product of its type<br>
i used it in my skid steer tires during a teardown of an old building<br>
i put the recommended amount in each tire<br>
initially we intended to keep track of nails in the tires but after a few days it was too many<br>
every morning we pulled out numerous nails varying in size from #3 to 30 (these are nearly 1/4 &quot; in diameter)<br>
The teardown and reconstruction is now over and the tires are still on the machine and the tires are still at 55 pounds preasure<br>
It has been 9 months<br>
Nearly as good as foam filling the tires<br>

After a year and a half of testing the Armada product in a variety of applications as well as wheel positions, I have found it exceeded our expectations.<br>
We started by using the product in 255/70R225 trailer tires ( 50 oz per wheel ) The air pressure was maintained , driver comments were the trailer pulled better with less vibration.<br>
We next installed the product in more trailer tires with same results.<br>
To determine what effect ARMADA had on wheel balance we started to install the product in steer tires .We took a couple of ways to test the effects on balancing .<br>
First we would balance the tires by conventional method of spinning tire and adding wheel weights, the truck would go into service for a few days to determine if there was any vibration or ride issue. The truck would then come back and we would remove the wheel weights and install Armada in each tire ( 11R225 &amp; 11R2245 60 oz per tire ) Ride and driver feed back was all positive with some drivers reporting improve in ride &amp;handling when Armada was installed.<br>
The scope of the testing was as follows<br>
ATV / Lawn &amp; Garden - Maintain air pressure as well a s reduce flat tires<br>
Implement - Maintain air pressure<br>
Travel Trailer/ Motor Home – Reduced blow outs due to low air pressure ( less damage to units ) Improved ride for trailer and motorhomes as product balanced the tires ranging from 225/75R16 up to 295/75R225<br>
OTR / Farm – Maintained air pressure ( stopped rim leaks as well as leaks pertaining to punctures )<br>
Medium Truck – Balancing on trucks &amp; trailers( less cupping in trailer application ) , maintained air pressure as well improved ride I drive and steer positions.<br>
We are very please with the Armada and will continue to use it in all applications.<br>
Thanks again<br>

Hello Marcel,<br>
I hope this letter finds you well. I just wanted to pass along my thanks for introducing our fleet to the Tire Lyna product. Our service runs a range of units from sedans, pickups, SUV&#39;s and Medium Duty Transports and we have tried your product across the board. The single most important key factor for us was the immediate elimination of flat tires in units equipped with Tire Lyna. I cannot express the importance of not having a flat. This product has far exceeded our expectations and is simpler to use than other run flat technologies that we have tried and at a much lower price point per unit. We have also experienced an increase in tire life and heat reduction, specifically on our larger medium duty fleet.<br>

Hi Noorez, Just wanted to thank you for the excellent service you have given us. We were very impressed how well your Tire Lyna gel worked for us. The Tire Protection alone, along with all the other safety benefits sure made us feel more secure with our tires. We had no tire balancing problems and our tires were running cooler. Your product did not interfere with our TPMS concern about pressure readings. Thank you for no more flats. Your product is excellent for all types of tires and it being biodegradable makes it even more appealing to all our customers. We love the fact that it is considered a green product. We recently did some cars, golf carts, electric scooters and trucks with our customers. We have some very happy customers now, since we solved their problems. Our dealers prefer selling the product as a fix the air leak instead of fix flats because more people have leaky tires than flats. We look forward to a long and continued business relationship.<br>

I have completed the cure test for the Tire Lyna/Tire Medic product you have been using with your fleet in Florida. The test was conducted at Bingham Tire &amp; Retreading (Goodyear Authorized Retreader). The product passed without any incident including up to 300 degrees and the standard 260 degree cure as well. Further more, there was no residue or damage to anything either in the tires or any equipment during the entire retread process. I left 5 ounces of product in 23 tires (usually tires are cleaned and washed out) and not only did it not ignite in the cure process but it dried and evaporated the remaining sealant from inside the tire. This product is retread friendly. It also washes out with water too!<br>
<br>
I hope this information helps,. This is the only sealant that I have tested that does not create a chamber fire!!!!<br>

Re: Tire Medic/Tire Lyna<br>
Bingham Tire &amp; Retreading has been retreading as a Goodyear Authorized Retreader since 2002. I have tried other tire sealants in the past that have made claims that their product is retreadable only to find out that they fail during the chamber cure process. We have tested the Tire Medic brand product through a full scale cure (at 260 degrees) successfully. The Tire Medic sealant did not cause a chamber fire and I would recommend this sealant to any customer looking to operate their fleet or equipment with the Tire Medic brand product. This is the only product that has proven itself through the retread process. I have to also mention that many sealants are hard to clean out of the tire. Your product easily washes right out of the tire with water. No pressure washer or cleaning agent of any kind is needed at all. Tire Medic is truly the best and most value added product on the market. It seals up to a ½” puncture! It also seals beads to reduce/ eliminate bead leaks. It works with TPMS systems, and to add to this your product is the only lab tested product ARDL (Akron Rubber Developmental Laboratories) on the market. Last but not least, this product lasts the lifetime of the tire! Your product does exactly what you say it does. We now have one product to service everything from a tire on a wheel barrow all the way up to a 63” Off Highway Tire!<br>

&quot;We have been running a fleet of Skid Steer Loaders for over 10 years. Over the years we have tried numerous products pumped into our tires to &quot;Stop Leaks&quot;. Three and half years ago we began using Tire Lyna. Our downtime due to flat tires has decreased remarkably.&quot;<br>
John Coombs, General Manager<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the major concerns to everyone who retreads tires is the quality of the casing and the ability for the casing to undergo standard inspection procedures. The decision to accept a tire for retreading is the decision to put a company&#39;s name on the final product. We tested Tire Lyna in one of our trucks for a period of four months and during the inspection stage we noticed it had sealed two nail punctures. Tire Lyna will not cause chamber fires; it is easily washes out and has passed our retread process.&quot;<br>

&quot;We have been using Tire Lyna with great success in our repair facility at United Rentals Langley BC since 1999. As you know the construction industry uses many different types of fasteners, which get dropped or lost on different job sites. Tire Lyna has helped reduce the service calls due to slow leaks caused by small punctures in tires. It has also increased our customer loyalty on the rental side.&quot;<br>
Wayne Patterson<br>
United Rentals , District Maintenance Manager<br>
<br>
&quot;I have used Tire Lyna, and prior to that, similar products for the last 30-35 years. Tire Lyna, in my opinion is the best of all the products I have used. It has sealed the most consistently, stays in place as it was designed to do and is easy to work around. My opinion is based on the use of the product as an air-loss preventative. This is my opinion, and not an expression on behalf of my company.&quot;<br>
Kelly Crouse<br>

&quot;Late last year we were introduced to another tire sealant brand that was supposed to be just as good as Tire Lyna but for less money. We get some pretty cold winters (-20 to -40 is not unusual) the other product froze solid in one of our tires at -20 while the Tire Lyna treated tires just kept on rolling without any issues ( it recently hit -37 here, no problems at all with the Tire Lyna treated tires) the other brand was a bit less expensive initially it ended up costing us a whole lot more money and time than Tire Lyna.&quot;<br>
Mike Richards<br>
<br>
&quot;I had tried every brand of sealer out there and did not work. We had so many plugs in the tires. I was searching the web and found Tire Lyna, call them and got a pail of their Tire Lyna. We dismounted all tires and cleaned them so there was no sealer in them. We installed Tire Lyna in the tires; we have had not one flat on the ATV’s since we installed Tire Lyna. We have saved on down time and overtime.<br>
It’s the best thing we have done to decrease our overhead.&quot;<br>

Last but not least, this product lasts the lifetime of the tire! Your product does exactly what you say it does. We now have one product to service everything from a tire on a wheel barrow all the way up to a 63” Off Highway Tire!<br>

&quot;We have been running a fleet of Skid Steer Loaders for over 10 years. Over the years we have tried numerous products pumped into our tires to &quot;Stop Leaks&quot;. Three and half years ago we began using Tire Lyna. Our downtime due to flat tires has decreased remarkably.&quot;<br>
John Coombs, General Manager<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the major concerns to everyone who retreads tires is the quality of the casing and the ability for the casing to undergo standard inspection procedures. The decision to accept a tire for retreading is the decision to put a company&#39;s name on the final product. We tested Tire Lyna in one of our trucks for a period of four months and during the inspection stage we noticed it had sealed two nail punctures. Tire Lyna will not cause chamber fires; it is easily washes out and has passed our retread process.&quot;<br>

&quot;We have been using Tire Lyna with great success in our repair facility at United Rentals Langley BC since 1999. As you know the construction industry uses many different types of fasteners, which get dropped or lost on different job sites. Tire Lyna has helped reduce the service calls due to slow leaks caused by small punctures in tires. It has also increased our customer loyalty on the rental side.&quot;<br>
Wayne Patterson<br>
United Rentals , District Maintenance Manager<br>
<br>
&quot;I have used Tire Lyna, and prior to that, similar products for the last 30-35 years. Tire Lyna, in my opinion is the best of all the products I have used. It has sealed the most consistently, stays in place as it was designed to do and is easy to work around. My opinion is based on the use of the product as an air-loss preventative. This is my opinion, and not an expression on behalf of my company.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Late last year we were introduced to another tire sealant brand that was supposed to be just as good as Tire Lyna but for less money. We get some pretty cold winters (-20 to -40 is not unusual) the other product froze solid in one of our tires at -20 while the Tire Lyna treated tires just kept on rolling without any issues ( it recently hit -37 here, no problems at all with the Tire Lyna treated tires) the other brand was a bit less expensive initially it ended up costing us a whole lot more money and time than Tire Lyna.&quot;<br>
Mike Richards<br>
<br>
&quot;I had tried every brand of sealer out there and did not work. We had so many plugs in the tires. I was searching the web and found Tire Lyna, call them and got a pail of their Tire Lyna. We dismounted all tires and cleaned them so there was no sealer in them. We installed Tire Lyna in the tires; we have had not one flat on the ATV’s since we installed Tire Lyna. We have saved on down time and overtime.<br>
It’s the best thing we have done to decrease our overhead.&quot;<br>

&quot;I was losing air from a bead leak and from a nail in one of my rigs tires (you could actually hear the air coming out) I remembered the product from the show and skeptical as I was I gave them a call as I figured I had nothing to lose except the cost to treat one tire (which turned out be $30.00, which is a hell of a lot less than a roadside tire repair!) They came out and treated the tire. I drove 15 - 20 ft forward and 15 - 20ft backward. Air leak gone. The next day at the end of my run I checked the tire that had been treated, no air pressure loss and much to my surprise the treated tire was cooler to the touch than the untreated tire beside it. Thank you Tire Lyna...&quot;<br>

&quot;We all know the importance of staying ahead of the first few groups in the morning allowing us to perform our tasks with minimal disruptions by our members. After out fitting all our turf grass equipment with Tire Lyna we have reduced our flat tires from an average of 14 per season to zero last year. This has not only reduced our equipment &amp; employee down time it has reduced our labor &amp; frustration.&quot;<br>
Dave Zeiler, Superintendent<br>
<br>
&quot;I have been operating skid steers for many years and always carried &quot;plug kits&quot; for on - site repairs. Now that I have Tire Lyna my down time is non-existent and productivity increased. The extra money in my pocket is a real bonus.&quot;<br>

&quot;After many months of talking to tire maintenance managers at several mines, one manager at became interested in trying Tire Lyna in order to protect his casings on his 240 MT haul trucks against heat damage. They have 26 haul trucks in that location. Belongs to GRUPO MEXICO, a very large company with mining operations in Mexico, Peru, Chile, USA, and other countries. After 15 days, the tire maintenance manager Raul was surprised to find out that the tires with Tire Lyna did not heat as much as the ones that did not have Tire Lyna. His deduction came from the charts that he prepared, and that we attach (next slide). He acknowledges that the coolest the tires operate, the longer they will live. Also, Raul mentioned that when he completes his evaluation, he expects to incorporate Tire Lyna as a stocking product at the mine, in order to use it in all their off road and mining tires.&quot;<br>

Hi Noorez,<br>
<br>
Work is starting to pick up, and I apologize for not getting back to you yet, but it went well! I still had an issue with air leaking from one tire, but I believe it’s my issue and not the sealant. It had a slow leak, but I just aired it up between heats and it held well enough.<br>
<br>
I put a couple of videos up on YouTube from our last race:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46C-xTAxXks<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-vHTN-t-nM<br>
<br>
Overall, I’m very impressed with the sealant! My ice tires have nearly 4000 drilled holes in them, partially plugged by screws, and only one hole generated a slow leak. I actually found a pre-drilled hole in one of my tires where I forgot to put a screw in, and that tire doesn’t leak at all. I’ll break the tire down and put a screw in it too, but that’s a good indicator of how well Tire Lyna works. I also have a group of off-road truck guys already interested in Tire Lyna. Slime helps a lot of off-road racers down south, but since it doesn’t work in freezing temps our local guys don’t even use it, but they’re looking for something that works. So far, other than my extra drilled holes in the tires, Tire Lyna is working great!<br>

I contacted Duffield sand and gravel. They have not had any other issues from that tire. They had lost no air; they have had no new splits and were loading continuously with this vehicle, every day until January 15 2014. The tires were replaced then.<br>

On July 5th 2012 we installed Tire Lyna into a 26.5R29 tire on one of our skid steer loaders. The tire was completely &quot;ringed&quot; with sidewall cracks/splits. The sidewall cracks/splits ranged in length from 2 to 11 inches and some were over an inch deep. We had to add air on a daily basis and looking back on it, the tire should have been replaced. A year later and counting the tire is still in service and has not lost one single pound of air!<br>
During this time no new splits have occurred and the existing ones have not become worse and we are continuously loading with this vehicle. The product really works.<br>
<br>
Noorez,<br>
I love the product and have seen it work with my own eyes. I would have NO issues backing up this product. I was sold when I could not get the beads on a 355/55D625 to seal. Pumped in the product, laid the tire/wheel assembly on either side for mere seconds. When I introduced the air, the product slightly blew out where the air was escaping then sealed instantly. I have never been called back to repair or air up that tire again. Make me the go to guy here in the GTA and I&#39;ll have no problem being your distributor. I could have truck delivering it full time.<br>

This review is from: TIRE LYNA 32A4262009 + Instant Tire Repair Gel 32 oz<br>
<br>
tire-lyna is the most effective product of its type<br>
i used it in my skid steer tires during a teardown of an old building<br>
i put the recommended amount in each tire<br>
initially we intended to keep track of nails in the tires but after a few days it was too many<br>
every morning we pulled out numerous nails varying in size from #3 to 30 (these are nearly 1/4 &quot; in diameter)<br>
The teardown and reconstruction is now over and the tires are still on the machine and the tires are still at 55 pounds preasure<br>
It has been 9 months<br>
Nearly as good as foam filling the tires<br>

After a year and a half of testing the Armada product in a variety of applications as well as wheel positions, I have found it exceeded our expectations.<br>
We started by using the product in 255/70R225 trailer tires ( 50 oz per wheel ) The air pressure was maintained , driver comments were the trailer pulled better with less vibration.<br>
We next installed the product in more trailer tires with same results.<br>
To determine what effect ARMADA had on wheel balance we started to install the product in steer tires .We took a couple of ways to test the effects on balancing .<br>
First we would balance the tires by conventional method of spinning tire and adding wheel weights, the truck would go into service for a few days to determine if there was any vibration or ride issue. The truck would then come back and we would remove the wheel weights and install Armada in each tire ( 11R225 &amp; 11R2245 60 oz per tire ) Ride and driver feed back was all positive with some drivers reporting improve in ride &amp;handling when Armada was installed.<br>
The scope of the testing was as follows<br>
ATV / Lawn &amp; Garden - Maintain air pressure as well a s reduce flat tires<br>
Implement - Maintain air pressure<br>
Travel Trailer/ Motor Home – Reduced blow outs due to low air pressure ( less damage to units ) Improved ride for trailer and motorhomes as product balanced the tires ranging from 225/75R16 up to 295/75R225<br>
OTR / Farm – Maintained air pressure ( stopped rim leaks as well as leaks pertaining to punctures )<br>
Medium Truck – Balancing on trucks &amp; trailers( less cupping in trailer application ) , maintained air pressure as well improved ride I drive and steer positions.<br>
We are very please with the Armada and will continue to use it in all applications.<br>
Thanks again<br>

Hello Marcel,<br>
I hope this letter finds you well. I just wanted to pass along my thanks for introducing our fleet to the Tire Lyna product. Our service runs a range of units from sedans, pickups, SUV&#39;s and Medium Duty Transports and we have tried your product across the board. The single most important key factor for us was the immediate elimination of flat tires in units equipped with Tire Lyna. I cannot express the importance of not having a flat. This product has far exceeded our expectations and is simpler to use than other run flat technologies that we have tried and at a much lower price point per unit. We have also experienced an increase in tire life and heat reduction, specifically on our larger medium duty fleet.<br>
<br>

Hi Noorez, Just wanted to thank you for the excellent service you have given us. We were very impressed how well your Tire Lyna gel worked for us. The Tire Protection alone, along with all the other safety benefits sure made us feel more secure with our tires. We had no tire balancing problems and our tires were running cooler. Your product did not interfere with our TPMS concern about pressure readings. Thank you for no more flats. Your product is excellent for all types of tires and it being biodegradable makes it even more appealing to all our customers. We love the fact that it is considered a green product. We recently did some cars, golf carts, electric scooters and trucks with our customers. We have some very happy customers now, since we solved their problems. Our dealers prefer selling the product as a fix the air leak instead of fix flats because more people have leaky tires than flats. We look forward to a long and continued business relationship.<br>

I have completed the cure test for the Tire Lyna/Tire Medic product you have been using with your fleet in Florida. The test was conducted at Bingham Tire &amp; Retreading (Goodyear Authorized Retreader). The product passed without any incident including up to 300 degrees and the standard 260 degree cure as well. Further more, there was no residue or damage to anything either in the tires or any equipment during the entire retread process. I left 5 ounces of product in 23 tires (usually tires are cleaned and washed out) and not only did it not ignite in the cure process but it dried and evaporated the remaining sealant from inside the tire. This product is retread friendly. It also washes out with water too!<br>
<br>
I hope this information helps,. This is the only sealant that I have tested that does not create a chamber fire!!!!<br>

Re: Tire Medic/Tire Lyna<br>
Bingham Tire &amp; Retreading has been retreading as a Goodyear Authorized Retreader since 2002. I have tried other tire sealants in the past that have made claims that their product is retreadable only to find out that they fail during the chamber cure process. We have tested the Tire Medic brand product through a full scale cure (at 260 degrees) successfully. The Tire Medic sealant did not cause a chamber fire and I would recommend this sealant to any customer looking to operate their fleet or equipment with the Tire Medic brand product. This is the only product that has proven itself through the retread process. I have to also mention that many sealants are hard to clean out of the tire. Your product easily washes right out of the tire with water. No pressure washer or cleaning agent of any kind is needed at all. Tire Medic is truly the best and most value added product on the market. It seals up to a ½” puncture! It also seals beads to reduce/ eliminate bead leaks. It works with TPMS systems, and to add to this your product is the only lab tested product ARDL (Akron Rubber Developmental Laboratories) on the market. Last but not least, this product lasts the lifetime of the tire! Your product does exactly what you say it does. We now have one product to service everything from a tire on a wheel barrow all the way up to a 63” Off Highway Tire!<br>
