After several years tax appeal working with three different Chartered Accountant firms, I found myself in the middle of multiple layers of mistakes made by CRA and by the accountants. Frustrated, I switched to Tax SOS for help, within just few short months, Tax SOS helped me to clear up all the errors and saved me over $40,000 in taxes.<br>

One nasty CRA tax auditor called unexpectedly to my store and demanded to review my payroll and GST account for last few years. I was extremely worried. Not knowing what to do, I hired Tax SOS to represent me. That was a right decision. Tax SOS not only negotiated a much smaller tax bill for me but also made the auditor to be not as nasty as in the beginning!<br>

 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 I owed a lot and was under threat from CRA that they will start wage garnishment of 30% of my pay. The rest will not be enough for us to live on.  Then I contacted Tax SOS. They helped me to get a pay plan that I could cope with. Now I am still paying my taxes monthly with enough left for my families to live on. The real plus is that my boss does not know my mess or I may lose my job.<br>

 It took a lot of courage for me to come out to look for help as I have not reported my freelance contractor income for many years. The fear of unknown paralyzed me. I called several places and only Tax SOS showed support and encouragement that are much needed for me. So I went for the initial consultation and then decided to have TAX SOS to help me with Voluntary Disclosure. Tax SOS team not only filed the VDP for me immediately (the same day right on the spot) but also helped me to draft some tax saving strategies that saved over $40K for me. Finally, I have done the right thing with the help of right company<br>

 When we got a tax audit notice, we hired Tax SOS right away. This is one of the best decisions we have made because the tremendous knowledge and expertise offered by Tax SOS team really helped me to pull through the hardest time of my life. If not for Tax SOS, we had to take auditors assessment which is surely much higher.<br>

When a friend referred a nice tax lady to me, I was happy since she helped me and my wife to get big refunds the same year. Three years later, we got audited by CRA asking for business expense receipts which we have no clue about. Trying to contact the tax lady and got no luck. Then we got these gross penalties for both. Not know what to do, I searched online and found Tax SOS for help. Very quickly we got the huge tax penalties removed. It is a big relief for us<br>

After several years tax appeal working with three different Chartered Accountant firms, I found myself in the middle of multiple layers of mistakes made by CRA and by the accountants. Frustrated, I switched to Tax SOS for help, within just few short months, Tax SOS helped me to clear up all the errors and saved me over $40,000 in taxes.<br>

One nasty CRA tax auditor called unexpectedly to my store and demanded to review my payroll and GST account for last few years. I was extremely worried. Not knowing what to do, I hired Tax SOS to represent me. That was a right decision. Tax SOS not only negotiated a much smaller tax bill for me but also made the auditor to be not as nasty as in the beginning!<br>

CRA got my bank account frozen. I couldnt even buy grocery. I had default my mortgage because of it.  Despaired, I called Tax SOS to get help. In just few days my problems were over. CRA released my bank. Thanks a lot guys for your quick help!<br>

<br>
- H. E. (Mississauga, ON)<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 I owed a lot and was under threat from CRA that they will start wage garnishment of 30% of my pay. The rest will not be enough for us to live on.  Then I contacted Tax SOS. They helped me to get a pay plan that I could cope with. Now I am still paying my taxes monthly with enough left for my families to live on. The real plus is that my boss does not know my mess or I may lose my job.<br>

 S. R. (Peterborough, ON)<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 It took a lot of courage for me to come out to look for help as I have not reported my freelance contractor income for many years. The fear of unknown paralyzed me. I called several places and only Tax SOS showed support and encouragement that are much needed for me. So I went for the initial consultation and then decided to have TAX SOS to help me with Voluntary Disclosure. Tax SOS team not only filed the VDP for me immediately (the same day right on the spot) but also helped me to draft some tax saving strategies that saved over $40K for me. Finally, I have done the right thing with the help of right company<br>

 I owe a lot of taxes (close to half a million). Tax SOS is managing my account with Collection guy from CRA. I know other people get legal actions taken on them for much smaller amount tax debts. Thanks to Tax SOSs help. They keep me out of troubles.<br>

 When we got a tax audit notice, we hired Tax SOS right away. This is one of the best decisions we have made because the tremendous knowledge and expertise offered by Tax SOS team really helped me to pull through the hardest time of my life. If not for Tax SOS, we had to take auditors assessment which is surely much higher.<br>

When a friend referred a nice tax lady to me, I was happy since she helped me and my wife to get big refunds the same year. Three years later, we got audited by CRA asking for business expense receipts which we have no clue about. Trying to contact the tax lady and got no luck. Then we got these gross penalties for both. Not know what to do, I searched online and found Tax SOS for help. Very quickly we got the huge tax penalties removed. It is a big relief for us<br>
