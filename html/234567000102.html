                            Web Site Design and Engineering<br>
The November Group views a Web site as a major corporate asset. Like other <br>
valuable assets, your Web site needs a sound design and <br>
development plan, as well as plans for maintenance, support and <br>
upgrades, so that you continue to get value and return from your <br>
investment. We are committed to understanding your goals, <br>
organizing and optimizing information for online delivery, and <br>
building a robust, reliable site. We make the most of our <br>
extensive experience to deliver:<br>
<br>
· A blueprint for the site that outlines what information is to <br>
be included and how it will be organized. <br>
· A user interface that makes navigation easy, natural and fast. <br>
· Well-written content so your information is clear and easy to <br>
understand.<br>
· Compelling graphics, which complement your organization&#39;s <br>
graphic identity and brand personality.<br>
· Top quality software engineering so your site can be lively and <br>
interactive; our technical staff does everything from creating 2D <br>
and 3D animations through to information-gathering forms that <br>
feed into legacy databases.<br>
· Thorough testing to ensure that the site is easy to use and <br>
reliable.<br>
<br>
At The November Group we recommend building a site in phases, beginning <br>
with an initial, manageable launch and then adding new content <br>
and capabilities as additional needs are identified.<br>
<br>
Our development approach involves integrating all of the <br>
components into a harmonious whole. At The November Group we enforce <br>
standards and checkpoints for customer satisfaction to ensure <br>
success and to meet or exceed our client&#39;s expectations and <br>
objectives.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Definition of Objectives<br>
The first question that needs to be answered before any work can <br>
begin is: What is the purpose of the site? When the goals have <br>
been clearly defined, our staff can begin executing a design that <br>
best fulfill those goals.<br>
<br>
Information Architecture<br>
Working with you, a preliminary map of the site is made at the <br>
conceptual level, including a site tree showing how the content <br>
will be organized, how the pages will link together, what <br>
features will be given priority and what will appear deeper in <br>
the site.<br>
<br>
Prototype Development<br>
Through a variety of prototyping methods, the &#39;look and feel&#39; of <br>
an interface is created and/or an interaction model is simulated <br>
to showcase functionality of an application. This allows a client <br>
to present the idea behind the site to management or end-users in <br>
order to arrive at a final design with specifications for the <br>
production process.<br>
<br>
Usability Testing<br>
Prototypes can be tested to ensure that the application or site <br>
is designed in an intuitive, easy-to-use manner and that it meets <br>
the needs of the end-user. This testing addresses any problems <br>
and corrects them before production begins.<br>
<br>
Content Preparation<br>
The content of the site will of course come from a variety of <br>
sources, with clients providing any relevant documentation and <br>
graphics and The November Group building on that to begin development.<br>
<br>
Production and Online Approvals<br>
At every step of the design and development of a Web site, <br>
clients will be involved in making decisions with The November Group about <br>
all aspects of the site. During the development process, the site <br>
will be in a secure, password-protected location on one of our <br>
Web servers, where clients can view the site as a work in <br>
progress. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Testing/Quality Control<br>
The November Group uses site management software and testing to ensure <br>
cross-platform compatibility, that the files, applets and CGIs <br>
that make up the content of the site are available and working, <br>
and that all of the links are valid. Software applications are <br>
put through a rigorous debugging trial to insure quality.<br>
<br>
Launch<br>
When all previous steps are complete, and client is completely <br>
satisfied, the site will be launched. Your Web site can be a very <br>
lonely place unless it is publicized. Our services include <br>
marketing and publicizing your Web site to all major Internet <br>
search engines, Usenet news groups and a host of other commercial <br>
sites available for this purpose. If needed, we will also develop <br>
a marketing communications program that will support your <br>
investment.<br>
<br>
You and your staff will also receive details on the internal <br>
steps you can take to market your new Web site to clients, <br>
suppliers and others with whom you do business.<br>
<br>
<br>
Success by Design<br>
In most projects, designers will work closely with clients at <br>
every step in the process to ensure that the site is moving in <br>
the right direction. And unlike print designers, Web designers at <br>
The November Group are familiar with the technologies of the Internet, <br>
which better enables them to design in such a way that their work <br>
is optimized for the Web. The look and feel as well as ease of <br>
use has a great impact on whether a site will be a success. In <br>
our experience, successful sites have a number of common traits:<br>
 <br>
Interactive<br>
Sometimes, customers come to us asking for a Web site that looks <br>
exactly like a printed publication. Instead, The November Group recommends <br>
re-examining the organization and quality of content for a World <br>
Wide Web site so as to maximize its interactive, non-sequential <br>
and in-depth capabilities. <br>
<br>
 Easy to Navigate<br>
It is crucial that a Web site be easy to navigate. The use of <br>
navigational tools such as bars or icons must be consistently <br>
placed on each page with indicators showing the current location <br>
of the viewer, and should include a link back to the home page, <br>
where new explorations can begin. <br>
<br>
Unified<br>
Consistent layout helps to create a unified site, which in turn <br>
complements a company&#39;s branding. Use of a tight color scheme and <br>
repetition of images not only helps to emphasize this <br>
consistency, but makes for a faster download as well. <br>
<br>
Automated<br>
The November Group suggests that clients consider incorporating automated <br>
mechanisms whenever possible to give their Web site a fresh look <br>
on a regular basis, while reducing the need for manual <br>
administration of the site. <br>
<br>
Quick to Download<br>
The November Group designers are experts at layering various images, colors <br>
and illustrations to produce rich, appealing graphics that pass <br>
our very stringent &#39;bandwidth&#39; limitations test. <br>
<br>
Technologically Advanced<br>
The November Group explores with all our customers the potential of using <br>
the latest interactive technologies when the technology will <br>
clearly complement client&#39;s communications objectives. <br>
<br>
Browser Friendly<br>
Our design staff is well versed with the limitations of various <br>
browsers, and designs within these parameters.<br>

                            Internet Consulting<br>
Understanding the Internet&#39;s potential and keeping abreast of <br>
changes can be time-consuming and requires expertise that many <br>
organizations lack. The November Group can help.<br>
<br>
We take the time to learn as much as possible about your <br>
organization so that together we can develop an Internet strategy <br>
that will work for you. <br>
<br>
We can help you understand the possibilities, and then create <br>
detailed recommendations for turning it into an effective, useful <br>
tool.<br>
<br>
Currently, marketing is the main focus for commercial Web sites <br>
on the Internet. However, customer support should also have a <br>
prominent role in an external Web. A Web site can help suppliers, <br>
dealers, or field reps stay in touch with company operations. It <br>
also can provide an excellent way to link customers directly to <br>
supplier information.<br>
<br>
The November Group can analyze an existing site and determine how to evolve <br>
it. <br>
<br>
We&#39;ll research your market and provide a report that details what <br>
your competitors are doing on the Internet, what you need to do <br>
to stay ahead of them, and more. <br>
Intranet Consulting<br>
On the inside of your organization, there are a number of <br>
information resources and transactions that are potential <br>
candidates for an Intranet. Every major company has reams of <br>
information that it must distribute to internal employees or <br>
external customers and suppliers. Web technology gives us a way <br>
to put all of these documents online for instant access by <br>
authorized users. <br>
<br>
When you look at the sheer volume of information stored by <br>
corporations today - including reams of printed information like <br>
computer documentation, procedures, specifications, and reference <br>
documents - you quickly see the argument for taking information <br>
online.<br>
<br>
Companies also have a number of electronic resources stored on <br>
computer that are traditionally distributed by transportable <br>
media or by copying across network nodes.<br>
With a Web browser like Netscape, you can catalog these resources <br>
online for user review and automatically distribute them - <br>
through a single mouse-click - across a network to any authorized <br>
user who requests them.<br>
<br>
Web browsers also give us a way to communicate with employees, <br>
customers, or suppliers, present information, capture feedback, <br>
and process the feedback automatically through databases or <br>
scripting mechanisms. They also support spontaneous user searches <br>
of information archives or databases. <br>
<br>
A well-designed Intranet can provide an excellent way to unify <br>
the far-flung operations of a company and increase the ease, <br>
frequency, and quality of inter-departmental communication.<br>
<br>
The November Group has all the expertise you need to get your <br>
Intranet started.<br>

                            E-Commerce<br>
<br>
Electronic commerce is emerging as a new and extraordinarily <br>
cost-effective way to do business. <br>
In 1996, some $2.6 billion in revenue was generated from <br>
transactions across the Internet. And analysts estimate that <br>
number will grow to be over $200 billion by 2001. <br>
<br>
About 5.2 million Canadians will use the Internet on a regular <br>
basis in 1998, and over 2 million homes will be connected by <br>
year&#39;s end. Thirty-four per cent of Canadian Net surfers will <br>
come from households with incomes of $50,000 to $59,000 a year, <br>
while those earning $60,000 to $79,000 will account for 18 per <br>
cent of Net users. <br>
<br>
Companies that are prepared for this explosion in Net use with <br>
well-developed strategies in place to take advantage of it will <br>
be in a position to potentially dominate their markets. They&#39;ll <br>
do so using mass-market, wafer-thin segmentation coupled with <br>
internal &quot;network-enabled&quot; capabilities to both target and <br>
deliver superior value propositions to their customers via <br>
electronic channels such as the Web.<br>
 <br>
Companies that are already online will have a significant head <br>
start on the competition, and the global network infrastructure <br>
holds so much promise as a medium for commercial transactions <br>
that future advances in network technology will make it even more <br>
imperative for companies to do business over the Internet. <br>
<br>
That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to start piloting and experimenting <br>
now, in order to develop an effective arsenal of customer <br>
connections that will strengthen relationships and add value to <br>
what you have to offer.<br>
<br>
The November Group is helping a number of our clients develop <br>
e-commerce strategies and solutions that work. No matter what a <br>
company&#39;s size or in-house expertise, invariably there are ways <br>
for any organization to conduct transactions over the Net.<br>

                            Web Site Design and Engineering<br>
The November Group views a Web site as a major corporate asset. Like other <br>
valuable assets, your Web site needs a sound design and <br>
development plan, as well as plans for maintenance, support and <br>
upgrades, so that you continue to get value and return from your <br>
investment. We are committed to understanding your goals, <br>
organizing and optimizing information for online delivery, and <br>
building a robust, reliable site. We make the most of our <br>
extensive experience to deliver:<br>
<br>
· A blueprint for the site that outlines what information is to <br>
be included and how it will be organized. <br>
· A user interface that makes navigation easy, natural and fast. <br>
· Well-written content so your information is clear and easy to <br>
understand.<br>
· Compelling graphics, which complement your organization&#39;s <br>
graphic identity and brand personality.<br>
· Top quality software engineering so your site can be lively and <br>
interactive; our technical staff does everything from creating 2D <br>
and 3D animations through to information-gathering forms that <br>
feed into legacy databases.<br>
· Thorough testing to ensure that the site is easy to use and <br>
reliable.<br>
<br>
At The November Group we recommend building a site in phases, beginning <br>
with an initial, manageable launch and then adding new content <br>
and capabilities as additional needs are identified.<br>
<br>
Our development approach involves integrating all of the <br>
components into a harmonious whole. At The November Group we enforce <br>
standards and checkpoints for customer satisfaction to ensure <br>
success and to meet or exceed our client&#39;s expectations and <br>
objectives.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Definition of Objectives<br>
The first question that needs to be answered before any work can <br>
begin is: What is the purpose of the site? When the goals have <br>
been clearly defined, our staff can begin executing a design that <br>
best fulfill those goals.<br>
<br>
Information Architecture<br>
Working with you, a preliminary map of the site is made at the <br>
conceptual level, including a site tree showing how the content <br>
will be organized, how the pages will link together, what <br>
features will be given priority and what will appear deeper in <br>
the site.<br>
<br>
Prototype Development<br>
Through a variety of prototyping methods, the &#39;look and feel&#39; of <br>
an interface is created and/or an interaction model is simulated <br>
to showcase functionality of an application. This allows a client <br>
to present the idea behind the site to management or end-users in <br>
order to arrive at a final design with specifications for the <br>
production process.<br>
<br>
Usability Testing<br>
Prototypes can be tested to ensure that the application or site <br>
is designed in an intuitive, easy-to-use manner and that it meets <br>
the needs of the end-user. This testing addresses any problems <br>
and corrects them before production begins.<br>
<br>
Content Preparation<br>
The content of the site will of course come from a variety of <br>
sources, with clients providing any relevant documentation and <br>
graphics and The November Group building on that to begin development.<br>
<br>
Production and Online Approvals<br>
At every step of the design and development of a Web site, <br>
clients will be involved in making decisions with The November Group about <br>
all aspects of the site. During the development process, the site <br>
will be in a secure, password-protected location on one of our <br>
Web servers, where clients can view the site as a work in <br>
progress. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Testing/Quality Control<br>
The November Group uses site management software and testing to ensure <br>
cross-platform compatibility, that the files, applets and CGIs <br>
that make up the content of the site are available and working, <br>
and that all of the links are valid. Software applications are <br>
put through a rigorous debugging trial to insure quality.<br>
<br>
Launch<br>
When all previous steps are complete, and client is completely <br>
satisfied, the site will be launched. Your Web site can be a very <br>
lonely place unless it is publicized. Our services include <br>
marketing and publicizing your Web site to all major Internet <br>
search engines, Usenet news groups and a host of other commercial <br>
sites available for this purpose. If needed, we will also develop <br>
a marketing communications program that will support your <br>
investment.<br>
<br>
You and your staff will also receive details on the internal <br>
steps you can take to market your new Web site to clients, <br>
suppliers and others with whom you do business.<br>
<br>
<br>
Success by Design<br>
In most projects, designers will work closely with clients at <br>
every step in the process to ensure that the site is moving in <br>
the right direction. And unlike print designers, Web designers at <br>
The November Group are familiar with the technologies of the Internet, <br>
which better enables them to design in such a way that their work <br>
is optimized for the Web. The look and feel as well as ease of <br>
use has a great impact on whether a site will be a success. In <br>
our experience, successful sites have a number of common traits:<br>
 <br>
Interactive<br>
Sometimes, customers come to us asking for a Web site that looks <br>
exactly like a printed publication. Instead, The November Group recommends <br>
re-examining the organization and quality of content for a World <br>
Wide Web site so as to maximize its interactive, non-sequential <br>
and in-depth capabilities. <br>
<br>
 Easy to Navigate<br>
It is crucial that a Web site be easy to navigate. The use of <br>
navigational tools such as bars or icons must be consistently <br>
placed on each page with indicators showing the current location <br>
of the viewer, and should include a link back to the home page, <br>
where new explorations can begin. <br>
<br>
Unified<br>
Consistent layout helps to create a unified site, which in turn <br>
complements a company&#39;s branding. Use of a tight color scheme and <br>
repetition of images not only helps to emphasize this <br>
consistency, but makes for a faster download as well. <br>
<br>
Automated<br>
The November Group suggests that clients consider incorporating automated <br>
mechanisms whenever possible to give their Web site a fresh look <br>
on a regular basis, while reducing the need for manual <br>
administration of the site. <br>
<br>
Quick to Download<br>
The November Group designers are experts at layering various images, colors <br>
and illustrations to produce rich, appealing graphics that pass <br>
our very stringent &#39;bandwidth&#39; limitations test. <br>
<br>
Technologically Advanced<br>
The November Group explores with all our customers the potential of using <br>
the latest interactive technologies when the technology will <br>
clearly complement client&#39;s communications objectives. <br>
<br>
Browser Friendly<br>
Our design staff is well versed with the limitations of various <br>
browsers, and designs within these parameters.<br>

                            Internet Consulting<br>
Understanding the Internet&#39;s potential and keeping abreast of <br>
changes can be time-consuming and requires expertise that many <br>
organizations lack. The November Group can help.<br>
<br>
We take the time to learn as much as possible about your <br>
organization so that together we can develop an Internet strategy <br>
that will work for you. <br>
<br>
We can help you understand the possibilities, and then create <br>
detailed recommendations for turning it into an effective, useful <br>
tool.<br>
<br>
Currently, marketing is the main focus for commercial Web sites <br>
on the Internet. However, customer support should also have a <br>
prominent role in an external Web. A Web site can help suppliers, <br>
dealers, or field reps stay in touch with company operations. It <br>
also can provide an excellent way to link customers directly to <br>
supplier information.<br>
<br>
The November Group can analyze an existing site and determine how to evolve <br>
it. <br>
<br>
We&#39;ll research your market and provide a report that details what <br>
your competitors are doing on the Internet, what you need to do <br>
to stay ahead of them, and more. <br>
Intranet Consulting<br>
On the inside of your organization, there are a number of <br>
information resources and transactions that are potential <br>
candidates for an Intranet. Every major company has reams of <br>
information that it must distribute to internal employees or <br>
external customers and suppliers. Web technology gives us a way <br>
to put all of these documents online for instant access by <br>
authorized users. <br>
<br>
When you look at the sheer volume of information stored by <br>
corporations today - including reams of printed information like <br>
computer documentation, procedures, specifications, and reference <br>
documents - you quickly see the argument for taking information <br>
online.<br>
<br>
Companies also have a number of electronic resources stored on <br>
computer that are traditionally distributed by transportable <br>
media or by copying across network nodes.<br>
With a Web browser like Netscape, you can catalog these resources <br>
online for user review and automatically distribute them - <br>
through a single mouse-click - across a network to any authorized <br>
user who requests them.<br>
<br>
Web browsers also give us a way to communicate with employees, <br>
customers, or suppliers, present information, capture feedback, <br>
and process the feedback automatically through databases or <br>
scripting mechanisms. They also support spontaneous user searches <br>
of information archives or databases. <br>
<br>
A well-designed Intranet can provide an excellent way to unify <br>
the far-flung operations of a company and increase the ease, <br>
frequency, and quality of inter-departmental communication.<br>
<br>
The November Group has all the expertise you need to get your <br>
Intranet started.<br>

                            E-Commerce<br>
<br>
Electronic commerce is emerging as a new and extraordinarily <br>
cost-effective way to do business. <br>
In 1996, some $2.6 billion in revenue was generated from <br>
transactions across the Internet. And analysts estimate that <br>
number will grow to be over $200 billion by 2001. <br>
<br>
About 5.2 million Canadians will use the Internet on a regular <br>
basis in 1998, and over 2 million homes will be connected by <br>
year&#39;s end. Thirty-four per cent of Canadian Net surfers will <br>
come from households with incomes of $50,000 to $59,000 a year, <br>
while those earning $60,000 to $79,000 will account for 18 per <br>
cent of Net users. <br>
<br>
Companies that are prepared for this explosion in Net use with <br>
well-developed strategies in place to take advantage of it will <br>
be in a position to potentially dominate their markets. They&#39;ll <br>
do so using mass-market, wafer-thin segmentation coupled with <br>
internal &quot;network-enabled&quot; capabilities to both target and <br>
deliver superior value propositions to their customers via <br>
electronic channels such as the Web.<br>
 <br>
Companies that are already online will have a significant head <br>
start on the competition, and the global network infrastructure <br>
holds so much promise as a medium for commercial transactions <br>
that future advances in network technology will make it even more <br>
imperative for companies to do business over the Internet. <br>
<br>
That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to start piloting and experimenting <br>
now, in order to develop an effective arsenal of customer <br>
connections that will strengthen relationships and add value to <br>
what you have to offer.<br>
<br>
The November Group is helping a number of our clients develop <br>
e-commerce strategies and solutions that work. No matter what a <br>
company&#39;s size or in-house expertise, invariably there are ways <br>
for any organization to conduct transactions over the Net.<br>
