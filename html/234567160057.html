When we bought our first house we knew it needed a brand new fresh coat of paint! Our contractor highly recommended we hire PG Paint &amp; Designand I&#39;m SO glad we did! They are so friendly and professional, right away I felt like they were working with us and cared about making our vision a reality. Working with PG Paint &amp; Design was wonderful and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a hassle free painting company in Ottawa for their project! They helped make our house our home.from Barrhaven-Ottawa, ON. Canada clients <br>
<br>
We have used PG Paint &amp; Design on multiple occasions while renovating our entire house. Throughout what can be a stressful process, Pino was a consummate professional and his positive attitude and customer first approach meant an exceptional painting job was completed. From the beginning, Pino was very effective at giving advice related tointerior wall repairs and paintingand this immeasurably assisted our decision making. He was also very flexible,which greatly aided in scheduling work on the house. His expertise and frankly, passion meant that any sign of renovations, whether on existingplaster walls or new drywall are non-existent. Additionally, he was always conscientious in cleaning up and seeking feedback throughout the project.  Pino has also worked on smaller projects for us, including re-painting vintage metal cabinet furniture.  Invariably these projects are completed with the same promptness and attention todetail as the large projects.  Pino was a pleasure to work with and we recommend him without reservation. in the Parkdale/Civic Hospital neighborhood of Ottawa, ON, Canada<br>
<br>
We had the pleasure of working with PG Paint &amp; Design on a top to bottom interior painting of our newly acquired 85 year old house. It was a lot of work which we needed completed in a relatively short time with a lot of it to be done in and around refinishing of floors, replacement of carpeting and while we were moving in. All of it accomplished on time and budget. Pino Germano is a true professional - meticulous with amazing attention to detail the quality of work including unforeseen plaster repairs was excellent. Next up is exterior painting and there is no question that we&#39;ll have PG Paint &amp; Design do the work. We highly recommend him. From a loyal Client in the Island Park area of Ottawa, <br>
<br>
I would recommend PG Paint and Design to anyone looking for beautiful and professional results. <br>
They completed the work within the time frame they gave me (a lot of companines make promises they can&#39;t keep) so I was able to plan around the time needed. This made coordinating with other contractors much easier. <br>
Defiantly will be using this company again! from happy client in the Findlay Creek area of Ottawa<br>
<br>
I have hired PG Paint and Design several times over the past 20 years and they have been outstanding! PG Paint and Design brings a high level of professionalism to each of their projects and executes flawlessly. My wife and I have always been happy with their work. I truly believe that Pino (owner) treats each house as if it is his own. If I have to sum up in one word the work of PG Paint &amp; Design it is trust. You can trust them to listen to your needs, you can trust them to provide professional advice and you can trust them to do an exceptional job. I highly recommend PG Paint and Design. from a client residing in the Nepean area of Ottawa<br>
<br>
My wife and I were introduced to Pino Germano many years ago by a neighbour in the renovation business. We invited him to do some repair and painting in our house, and have never looked back, i.e., have used Mr. Germano for all our paint and related design and repair work since. This includes our home, inside and out, and our cottage. Our projects have varied from minor (e.g., deck re-staining, under $500) to major (e.g., whole home exterior, or main floor interior, involving several thousand dollars). Over more than 15 years we have relied on him to: <br>
<br>
- fit us into his schedule with considerable flexibility; <br>
- always work cheerfully, and incredibly efficiently and quickly... we&#39;re always surprised how much he accomplishes in a short time frame; <br>
- in spite of the speed, produce impeccable results ... he won&#39;t take shortcuts that might compromise quality. Work is always &quot;prepped&quot; with needed repairs, so that the results are first class down to every detail. (We can think of occasions then we thought the work was fine, but he decided it needed redoing/improving!). <br>
<br>
Depending on the size and complexity of the job, Mr. Germano brings with him one or two mature, experienced colleagues, who are equally friendly and obviously love their work (and working together).<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve recommended PG Paint &amp; Design to many friends and neighbours over the years, who have thanked us for the excellent and satisfying suggestion. We&#39;ll continue to do this. from our Rockcliffe and Rockcliffe Park area loyal clients.<br>

<br>
When we bought our first house we knew it needed a brand new fresh coat of paint! Our contractor highly recommended we hire PG Paint &amp; Designand I&#39;m SO glad we did! They are so friendly and professional, right away I felt like they were working with us and cared about making our vision a reality. Working with PG Paint &amp; Design was wonderful and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a hassle free painting company in Ottawa for their project! They helped make our house our home.from Barrhaven-Ottawa, ON. Canada clients <br>
<br>
We have used PG Paint &amp; Design on multiple occasions while renovating our entire house. Throughout what can be a stressful process, Pino was a consummate professional and his positive attitude and customer first approach meant an exceptional painting job was completed. From the beginning, Pino was very effective at giving advice related tointerior wall repairs and paintingand this immeasurably assisted our decision making. He was also very flexible,which greatly aided in scheduling work on the house. His expertise and frankly, passion meant that any sign of renovations, whether on existingplaster walls or new drywall are non-existent. Additionally, he was always conscientious in cleaning up and seeking feedback throughout the project.  Pino has also worked on smaller projects for us, including re-painting vintage metal cabinet furniture.  Invariably these projects are completed with the same promptness and attention todetail as the large projects.  Pino was a pleasure to work with and we recommend him without reservation. in the Parkdale/Civic Hospital neighborhood of Ottawa, ON, Canada<br>
<br>
We had the pleasure of working with PG Paint &amp; Design on a top to bottom interior painting of our newly acquired 85 year old house. It was a lot of work which we needed completed in a relatively short time with a lot of it to be done in and around refinishing of floors, replacement of carpeting and while we were moving in. All of it accomplished on time and budget. Pino Germano is a true professional - meticulous with amazing attention to detail the quality of work including unforeseen plaster repairs was excellent. Next up is exterior painting and there is no question that we&#39;ll have PG Paint &amp; Design do the work. We highly recommend him. From a loyal Client in the Island Park area of Ottawa, <br>
<br>
I would recommend PG Paint and Design to anyone looking for beautiful and professional results. <br>
They completed the work within the time frame they gave me (a lot of companines make promises they can&#39;t keep) so I was able to plan around the time needed. This made coordinating with other contractors much easier. <br>
Defiantly will be using this company again! from happy client in the Findlay Creek area of Ottawa<br>
<br>
I have hired PG Paint and Design several times over the past 20 years and they have been outstanding! PG Paint and Design brings a high level of professionalism to each of their projects and executes flawlessly. My wife and I have always been happy with their work. I truly believe that Pino (owner) treats each house as if it is his own. If I have to sum up in one word the work of PG Paint &amp; Design it is trust. You can trust them to listen to your needs, you can trust them to provide professional advice and you can trust them to do an exceptional job. I highly recommend PG Paint and Design. from a client residing in the Nepean area of Ottawa<br>
<br>
My wife and I were introduced to Pino Germano many years ago by a neighbour in the renovation business. We invited him to do some repair and painting in our house, and have never looked back, i.e., have used Mr. Germano for all our paint and related design and repair work since. This includes our home, inside and out, and our cottage. Our projects have varied from minor (e.g., deck re-staining, under $500) to major (e.g., whole home exterior, or main floor interior, involving several thousand dollars). Over more than 15 years we have relied on him to: <br>
<br>
- fit us into his schedule with considerable flexibility; <br>
- always work cheerfully, and incredibly efficiently and quickly... we&#39;re always surprised how much he accomplishes in a short time frame; <br>
- in spite of the speed, produce impeccable results ... he won&#39;t take shortcuts that might compromise quality. Work is always &quot;prepped&quot; with needed repairs, so that the results are first class down to every detail. (We can think of occasions then we thought the work was fine, but he decided it needed redoing/improving!). <br>
<br>
Depending on the size and complexity of the job, Mr. Germano brings with him one or two mature, experienced colleagues, who are equally friendly and obviously love their work (and working together).<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve recommended PG Paint &amp; Design to many friends and neighbours over the years, who have thanked us for the excellent and satisfying suggestion. We&#39;ll continue to do this. from our Rockcliffe and Rockcliffe Park area loyal clients.<br>
