              MEDIAFORCE has had the opportunity of working with many companies and people throughout the years and we&#39;ve developed great working relationships.<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s a little of what they had to say:<br>
<br>
In the fall of 2012 we began interviewing over 35 companies Canada wide for the development and maintenance of a new website for the Facial Surgery &amp; Cosmetic Centre of Ottawa, Inc. We were looking for a company that could create a dynamic website, write content, perform SEO and provide solid marketing strategies specific to our industry. Christine, our office administrator first spoke with Joe Bongiorno, President and CEO at MediaForce over the phone, at which time found him to be friendly, approachable and very competent. After just one meeting with Joe we knew we found the company we were looking for. Working with the team at MedicaForce over the past few months has been an extremely positive and enjoyable experience. All members of this talented group exhibit a high level of professionalism, are courteous as well as extremely knowledgeable in their areas of expertise. They offer excellent customer service and are always friendly and prompt to get back to us if we have questions or concerns. We are excited about working with MediaForce and look forward to a long term business relationship.<br>

I have worked with Mediaforce team for nearly two years and I appreciate their professionalism day in day out. Responses to requests are prompt and the company is flexible in meeting specific needs. They successfully designed our online directory (http://www.europeincanada.ca/), with a great final product. Overall, excellent service.<br>

   I have worked with MEDIAFORCE for the past year. In this time, Joe Bongiorno, President and CEO, has designed and developed a website for the Language &amp; Communication Assessment Project. We have worked very well at a distance and I have been extremely pleased with the service. He is professional, prompt, reliable, and the quality of his work has exceeded our expectations. <br>

   I would like to extend my personal thanks as well as those of our entire senior management team for your work developing our web site. BreconRidge competes in the EMS Electronics Manufacturing Sub contractor market space and our web site is an important show piece for us. The work your team performed for us is exactly what we hoped to achieve. We feel the site is in line with our expectations without being too close to our competition. We appreciated the flexibility you provided to us in your working hours and your responsiveness to our time demands.<br>

   Thanks Joe, I just wanted to say that almost every email we get relating to something on the website includes a statement about how excellent the site really is. It is very positive and encouraging; applause keeps rolling in about the design look and feel. I could not have hoped for a better working collaboration than the one I had with Joe on the site. MEDIAFORCE has been yet another example of really fine and really talented people who have been referred on to me. I am very lucky to have been able to surround myself with folks like you.<br>

   I wish to express my complete confidence in MediaForce and Joe Bongiorno.  Our program is located in Calgary, Alberta and required a &quot;new <br>
look&quot; overhaul of our website. I am extremely pleased, as are the Directors, with the service and response that MediaForce offers.  The distance between Ottawa and Calgary has never been <br>
an issue.  <br>

   Dear Joe, thank you again so much for the fantastic job you did! I love the new website you set up for me. I am especially happy that all the continuing major and minor changes and updates can be managed so very effortlessly and quickly even though we&#39;re thousands of kilometers apart. Working so effortlessly with a web service company is indeed a new experience for me: The previous company I had hired was located in my home town here in Germany - however, that didn&#39;t lead to an easier collaboration. In fact communication with them was a lot more complicated and took way longer. So congratulations on the way you&#39;re organized - however you do that, it seems to be just right and perfect.<br>

   we cannot imagine how much more accessible or responsive MediaForce could have been had they been based right here in Halifax. Our E-mails were responded to within 24 hours...usually less and with clear and succinct answers.<br>

   I would like to thank you and your staff for the excellent job you did producing our internal web tracking system. To your credit the complexity of the design and implementation of business rules is almost invisible to the user who sees nothing but a visually stunning web interface. Using a database and active pages as a frame work has allowed us to use the site and the information it captures in ways that we didn&#39;t think of in the initial design. In addition having your staff onsite during the complete implementation was great, things went faster and with much less tuning than we had estimated. Everyone on your team was great to work with and quite competent.<br>

              MEDIAFORCE has had the opportunity of working with many companies and people throughout the years and we&#39;ve developed great working relationships.<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s a little of what they had to say:<br>
<br>
In the fall of 2012 we began interviewing over 35 companies Canada wide for the development and maintenance of a new website for the Facial Surgery &amp; Cosmetic Centre of Ottawa, Inc. We were looking for a company that could create a dynamic website, write content, perform SEO and provide solid marketing strategies specific to our industry. Christine, our office administrator first spoke with Joe Bongiorno, President and CEO at MediaForce over the phone, at which time found him to be friendly, approachable and very competent. After just one meeting with Joe we knew we found the company we were looking for. Working with the team at MedicaForce over the past few months has been an extremely positive and enjoyable experience. All members of this talented group exhibit a high level of professionalism, are courteous as well as extremely knowledgeable in their areas of expertise. They offer excellent customer service and are always friendly and prompt to get back to us if we have questions or concerns. We are excited about working with MediaForce and look forward to a long term business relationship.<br>

I have worked with Mediaforce team for nearly two years and I appreciate their professionalism day in day out. Responses to requests are prompt and the company is flexible in meeting specific needs. They successfully designed our online directory (http://www.europeincanada.ca/), with a great final product. Overall, excellent service.<br>

   I have worked with MEDIAFORCE for the past year. In this time, Joe Bongiorno, President and CEO, has designed and developed a website for the Language &amp; Communication Assessment Project. We have worked very well at a distance and I have been extremely pleased with the service. He is professional, prompt, reliable, and the quality of his work has exceeded our expectations. <br>

   I would like to extend my personal thanks as well as those of our entire senior management team for your work developing our web site. BreconRidge competes in the EMS Electronics Manufacturing Sub contractor market space and our web site is an important show piece for us. The work your team performed for us is exactly what we hoped to achieve. We feel the site is in line with our expectations without being too close to our competition. We appreciated the flexibility you provided to us in your working hours and your responsiveness to our time demands.<br>

   Thanks Joe, I just wanted to say that almost every email we get relating to something on the website includes a statement about how excellent the site really is. It is very positive and encouraging; applause keeps rolling in about the design look and feel. I could not have hoped for a better working collaboration than the one I had with Joe on the site. MEDIAFORCE has been yet another example of really fine and really talented people who have been referred on to me. I am very lucky to have been able to surround myself with folks like you.<br>

   I wish to express my complete confidence in MediaForce and Joe Bongiorno.  Our program is located in Calgary, Alberta and required a &quot;new <br>
look&quot; overhaul of our website. I am extremely pleased, as are the Directors, with the service and response that MediaForce offers.  The distance between Ottawa and Calgary has never been <br>
an issue.  <br>

   Dear Joe, thank you again so much for the fantastic job you did! I love the new website you set up for me. I am especially happy that all the continuing major and minor changes and updates can be managed so very effortlessly and quickly even though we&#39;re thousands of kilometers apart. Working so effortlessly with a web service company is indeed a new experience for me: The previous company I had hired was located in my home town here in Germany - however, that didn&#39;t lead to an easier collaboration. In fact communication with them was a lot more complicated and took way longer. So congratulations on the way you&#39;re organized - however you do that, it seems to be just right and perfect.<br>

   we cannot imagine how much more accessible or responsive MediaForce could have been had they been based right here in Halifax. Our E-mails were responded to within 24 hours...usually less and with clear and succinct answers.<br>

   I have had the pleasure of working with Joe Bongiorno and the Media Force team on several projects..projects, both Federal and Provincial government web sites. In all cases, Joe has delivered a final product beyond our original expectations.<br>

   I would like to thank you and your staff for the excellent job you did producing our internal web tracking system. To your credit the complexity of the design and implementation of business rules is almost invisible to the user who sees nothing but a visually stunning web interface. Using a database and active pages as a frame work has allowed us to use the site and the information it captures in ways that we didn&#39;t think of in the initial design. In addition having your staff onsite during the complete implementation was great, things went faster and with much less tuning than we had estimated. Everyone on your team was great to work with and quite competent.<br>
