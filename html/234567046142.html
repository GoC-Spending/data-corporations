                            Primavera Project Planner (P3) is best suited for complex or <br>
multiple projects which require integrated scheduling, resource <br>
allocation and leveling, and cost control at the corporate <br>
level. Since projects are disk-resident in P3, it easily <br>
supports large projects with thousands of activities. Using P3 <br>
also establishes a consistent structure for all projects.<br>

                            Primavera SureTrak 3.0<br>
SureTrak Project Manager is a team-level tool for planning and <br>
scheduling detailed tasks at the individual resource level. <br>
Applying Enterprise Project Management in this environment, each <br>
project team uses SureTrak to manage its own project. Because <br>
projects in SureTrak are memory-resident, scheduling results are <br>
immediate; however, SureTrak performance is optimal with smaller <br>
projects.<br>

                            In today&#39;s business world, reliable plans make all the <br>
difference. And while your project plan needs to be developed <br>
and cared for, it only explains HOW you will deliver the work. <br>
This is where Requirements Management kicks in.<br>
<br>
While project management is concerned with how you plan to <br>
deliver the product, requirements Management focuses on WHAT <br>
that product is and helps control its evolution. Identifying <br>
product requirements and specifications as well as ensuring that <br>
changes to those are well coordinated with everybody requires <br>
discipline and the tools to support it.<br>
<br>
At PMC, we can provide the building blocks to help make it all <br>
happen: plan and manage BOTH the project and the product.<br>
<br>
Telelogic DOORS provides all the features needed to capture, <br>
track and manage user requirements. You can enter your <br>
requirements directly into DOORS, using its familiar word <br>
processor style interface.  Once you&#39;ve captured your <br>
requirements in DOORS, you can track and manage them throughout <br>
the project life cycle using a variety of features, such as <br>
views, links and traceability analyses.<br>

                            PMConnex is built by Project Management Centre (PMC) as an <br>
integration application that allows users and organizations to <br>
link Primavera Enterprise and Telelogic DOORS, two key <br>
information tools used to support project delivery.<br>
<br>
PMConnex lets Primavera and DOORS exchange information so that <br>
project managers and other project team members can quickly <br>
assess the impact on the product plan of changes to the project <br>
plan and vice-versa. It reduces time spent in meetings, <br>
accelerates the change control process and ensures everyone is <br>
kept informed of relevant information regarding their <br>
deliverables.<br>
<br>
To achieve this integration, PMConnex uses both the Primavera <br>
SDK (Software Development Kit) that comes with Primavera <br>
Enterprise and TeamPlay and Telelogic DOORS DXL scripts that <br>
load with the application whenever DOORS is launched.<br>
<br>
PMConnex delivers the following capability:<br>
<br>
1) 2-way transfer of project WBS elements so that they can be <br>
viewed in DOORS and linked to requirement module objects as well <br>
as allow DOORS users to submit additional WBS elements. Also, <br>
the names of linked objects in DOORS are listed in the WBS <br>
Notebook topics in Primavera;  <br>
2) Transfer of OBS elements from Primavera to DOORS;  <br>
3) 2-way transfer of project risks and issues allowing team <br>
members to view them in DOORS as well as submit them to the <br>
Primavera project managers. <br>

                            In today&#39;s business world, reliable plans make all the <br>
difference. And while your project plan needs to be developed <br>
and cared for, it only explains HOW you will deliver the work. <br>
This is where Requirements Management kicks in.<br>
<br>
While project management is concerned with how you plan to <br>
deliver the product, requirements Management focuses on WHAT <br>
that product is and helps control its evolution. Identifying <br>
product requirements and specifications as well as ensuring that <br>
changes to those are well coordinated with everybody requires <br>
discipline and the tools to support it.<br>
<br>
At PMC, we can provide the building blocks to help make it all <br>
happen: plan and manage BOTH the project and the product.<br>
<br>
Telelogic DOORS provides all the features needed to capture, <br>
track and manage user requirements. You can enter your <br>
requirements directly into DOORS, using its familiar word <br>
processor style interface.  Once you&#39;ve captured your <br>
requirements in DOORS, you can track and manage them throughout <br>
the project life cycle using a variety of features, such as <br>
views, links and traceability analyses<br>

            PMConnex<br>
<br>
PMConnex is built by PMC Project Management Centre Inc as an <br>
integration application that allows users and organizations to <br>
link Primavera Enterprise and Telelogic DOORS, two key <br>
information tools used to support project delivery.<br>
<br>
PMConnex lets Primavera and DOORS exchange information so that <br>
project managers and other project team members can quickly <br>
assess the impact on the product plan of changes to the project <br>
plan and vice-versa. It reduces time spent in meetings, <br>
accelerates the change control process and ensures everyone is <br>
kept informed of relevant information regarding their <br>
deliverables.<br>
<br>
To achieve this integration, PMConnex uses both the Primavera <br>
SDK (Software Development Kit) that comes with Primavera <br>
Enterprise and TeamPlay and Telelogic DOORS DXL scripts that <br>
load with the application whenever DOORS is launched.<br>
<br>
PMConnex delivers the following capability:<br>
<br>
1) 2-way transfer of project WBS elements so that they can be <br>
viewed in DOORS and linked to requirement module objects as well <br>
as allow DOORS users to submit additional WBS elements. Also, <br>
the names of linked objects in DOORS are listed in the WBS <br>
Notebook topics in Primavera;  <br>
2) Transfer of OBS elements from Primavera to DOORS;  <br>
3) 2-way transfer of project risks and issues allowing team <br>
members to view them in DOORS as well as submit them to the <br>
Primavera project managers. <br>

                            Primavera Project Planner (P3) is best suited for complex or <br>
multiple projects which require integrated scheduling, resource <br>
allocation and leveling, and cost control at the corporate <br>
level. Since projects are disk-resident in P3, it easily <br>
supports large projects with thousands of activities. Using P3 <br>
also establishes a consistent structure for all projects.<br>

SureTrak Project Manager is a team-level tool for planning and <br>
scheduling detailed tasks at the individual resource level. <br>
Applying Enterprise Project Management in this environment, each <br>
project team uses SureTrak to manage its own project. Because <br>
projects in SureTrak are memory-resident, scheduling results are <br>
immediate; however, SureTrak performance is optimal with smaller <br>
projects.<br>

                            In today&#39;s business world, reliable plans make all the <br>
difference. And while your project plan needs to be developed <br>
and cared for, it only explains HOW you will deliver the work. <br>
This is where Requirements Management kicks in.<br>
<br>
While project management is concerned with how you plan to <br>
deliver the product, requirements Management focuses on WHAT <br>
that product is and helps control its evolution. Identifying <br>
product requirements and specifications as well as ensuring that <br>
changes to those are well coordinated with everybody requires <br>
discipline and the tools to support it.<br>
<br>
At PMC, we can provide the building blocks to help make it all <br>
happen: plan and manage BOTH the project and the product.<br>
<br>
Telelogic DOORS provides all the features needed to capture, <br>
track and manage user requirements. You can enter your <br>
requirements directly into DOORS, using its familiar word <br>
processor style interface.  Once you&#39;ve captured your <br>
requirements in DOORS, you can track and manage them throughout <br>
the project life cycle using a variety of features, such as <br>
views, links and traceability analyses.<br>

                            PMConnex is built by Project Management Centre (PMC) as an <br>
integration application that allows users and organizations to <br>
link Primavera Enterprise and Telelogic DOORS, two key <br>
information tools used to support project delivery.<br>
<br>
PMConnex lets Primavera and DOORS exchange information so that <br>
project managers and other project team members can quickly <br>
assess the impact on the product plan of changes to the project <br>
plan and vice-versa. It reduces time spent in meetings, <br>
accelerates the change control process and ensures everyone is <br>
kept informed of relevant information regarding their <br>
deliverables.<br>
<br>
To achieve this integration, PMConnex uses both the Primavera <br>
SDK (Software Development Kit) that comes with Primavera <br>
Enterprise and TeamPlay and Telelogic DOORS DXL scripts that <br>
load with the application whenever DOORS is launched.<br>
<br>

                            In today&#39;s business world, reliable plans make all the <br>
difference. And while your project plan needs to be developed <br>
and cared for, it only explains HOW you will deliver the work. <br>
This is where Requirements Management kicks in.<br>
<br>
While project management is concerned with how you plan to <br>
deliver the product, requirements Management focuses on WHAT <br>
that product is and helps control its evolution. Identifying <br>
product requirements and specifications as well as ensuring that <br>
changes to those are well coordinated with everybody requires <br>
discipline and the tools to support it.<br>
<br>
At PMC, we can provide the building blocks to help make it all <br>
happen: plan and manage BOTH the project and the product.<br>
<br>
Telelogic DOORS provides all the features needed to capture, <br>
track and manage user requirements. You can enter your <br>
requirements directly into DOORS, using its familiar word <br>
processor style interface.  Once you&#39;ve captured your <br>
requirements in DOORS, you can track and manage them throughout <br>
the project life cycle using a variety of features, such as <br>
views, links and traceability analyses<br>

how to setup users, maintain security, and define global data <br>
items, such as calendars and activity codes. Other lessons will <br>
aid project managers in creating budgets, modifying multiple <br>
activities using global change, and performing extensive earned <br>
value analysis. Many options for sharing project information <br>
will be covered including: Project Website, project check in/out <br>
and project import/export.<br>

            PMConnex<br>
<br>
PMConnex is built by PMC Project Management Centre Inc as an <br>
integration application that allows users and organizations to <br>
link Primavera Enterprise and Telelogic DOORS, two key <br>
information tools used to support project delivery.<br>
<br>
PMConnex lets Primavera and DOORS exchange information so that <br>
project managers and other project team members can quickly <br>
assess the impact on the product plan of changes to the project <br>
plan and vice-versa. It reduces time spent in meetings, <br>
accelerates the change control process and ensures everyone is <br>
kept informed of relevant information regarding their <br>
deliverables.<br>
<br>
To achieve this integration, PMConnex uses both the Primavera <br>
SDK (Software Development Kit) that comes with Primavera <br>
Enterprise and TeamPlay and Telelogic DOORS DXL scripts that <br>
load with the application whenever DOORS is launched.<br>
<br>
PMConnex delivers the following capability:<br>
<br>
1) 2-way transfer of project WBS elements so that they can be <br>
viewed in DOORS and linked to requirement module objects as well <br>
as allow DOORS users to submit additional WBS elements. Also, <br>
the names of linked objects in DOORS are listed in the WBS <br>
Notebook topics in Primavera;  <br>
2) Transfer of OBS elements from Primavera to DOORS;  <br>
3) 2-way transfer of project risks and issues allowing team <br>
members to view them in DOORS as well as submit them to the <br>
Primavera project managers. <br>
