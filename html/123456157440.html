(&quot;Thermal&quot;) is an engineering <br>firm dedicated to innovative engineering of waste heat recovery/energy reduction and air pollution control solutions.  Thermal developed its own FLU-ACE® <br>technology: a combination of  heat  <br>recovery and air pollution control systems  which significantly reduce emissions of  <br>&quot;Greenhouse Gases&quot;, &quot;Acid Gases&quot;, Nitrogen Oxides, VOCs, <br> heavy metals, and particulate matter while simultaneously  <br>recovering 80% to 90% of the heat normally wasted in hot flue <br>gases.  FLU-ACE® systems are beneficially applied to exhausts <br>from various boilers, industrial dryers, kilns, furnaces,  <br>cogeneration units, incinerators, etc., and are custom designed <br>for full integration into process water and air heating, as well <br>as into space heating systems.    <br><br>Low NOx Process and Low NOx FLU-ACE® for up to 90% NOx (as both <br>NO and NO2) removal from flue gases of fossil fuel combustion <br>sources, i.e. coal, oil, wood waste, and natural gas fired <br>boilers, e.g. in power plants, is the newest addition to <br>Thermal&#39;s products.  This cost efficient Low NOx Process <br>technology and the Low NOx FLU-ACE® System is protected by <br>patents in 42 countries. <br><br>In implementing energy conservation and air pollution control <br>turnkey (design build) projects Thermal works in strategic <br>alliances with global companies such as Johnson Controls L.P. (NYSE:JCI).  The <br>Johnson/Thermal team jointly provides the FLU-ACE solutions with performance guarantees and other economic support.<br><br>Thermal Energy International Inc., was  founded in 1985 and incorporated in 1991, its  <br>shares being publicly traded at theTSX Venture Exchange <br> under the symbol TMG.<br><br>The corporation is a specialized engineering firm dedicated to <br>innovative engineering, marketing, construction, installation, <br>and servicing of air pollution control and heat recovery systems <br>for numerous applications.  The corporation developed its own <br>FLU-ACE® technology: a combination of heat recovery and air <br>pollution control systems which recover 80% to 90% of the heat <br>normally wasted in hot flue gases and simultaneously reduce the <br>emission of &quot;Greenhouse Gases&quot;, &quot;Acid Gases&quot;, Nitrogen Oxides, <br>VOCs, heavy metals, and particulate matter, hence,  eliminating <br>the need for large boiler plant stacks or chimneys.  The systems, <br>sold under the brand name FLU-ACE®, are made from stainless steel <br>and plastic, designed and produced in a variety <br>of configurations that are custom designed for full integration <br>into process water and/or air heating systems, space heating, <br>ventilating, and air conditioning (or H.V.A.C.) systems for <br>existing facilities. <br><br>FLU-ACE® technology is competitively priced to provide a <br>relatively short return on investment.FLU-ACE® systems are <br>beneficially applied to exhausts from all kinds of boilers, <br> kilns, industrial dryers, furnaces, cogeneration units, and <br>incinerators.  Food processing plants, beverage producers, pulp <br>and paper plants, manufacturing plants, petrochemical plants,  <br>hospitals, large school campuses, universities, mines, sewage <br>treatment plants, etc. greatly benefit from installing the <br>corporation&#39;s FLU-ACE® systems.  A two-year simple payback period <br>(36% Return on Investment) for FLU-ACE® capital investment is <br>typically achieved in industrial applications; three to five-year <br>pay back in seasonal space heating applications.  The life <br>expectancy of a FLU-ACE® system is at least thirty-five (35) <br>years.  <br><br> The corporation built numerous turnkey FLU-ACE® systems in <br>Canada including combined FLU-ACE®/Turbine or Engine Power <br>Generator/Boiler systems and designed over 30 other systems for <br>District Heating Plants, Pulp and Paper Mills, Thermal Power <br>Plants, and Incineration Plants.  All installations have achieved <br>tremendous success in saving the customers&#39; energy (money), while <br>reducing their emissions of harmful pollutants.  All of the <br>FLU-ACE® <br>installations in Ontario have been approved by the Ontario <br>Ministry of Environment and Energy.    <br><br>Thermal Energy International Inc. has continuously invested into <br>research and development of new and into improvement of existing <br>technologies.  <br><br>The newest additions to the corporation&#39;s family of products are <br>Low NOx Process and Low NOx FLU-ACE® System for up to 90% NOx  <br>removal from flue gases of fossil fuel combustion sources, i.e. <br>coal, oil, wood waste, natural gas fired boilers, etc., e.g.  in  <br>power plants. These cost efficient technologies are protected by <br>patents in 42 countries, including U.S.A., Canada, Australia, New <br>Zealand, Brazil, China, Europe, and Eurasia.<br><br>

                            The LowNOx Process efficiently and cost effectively removes up to <br>
90% of NOx as both NO and NO2.  The LowNOx Process is a two-step <br>
process, with the first step as the gas phase chemical <br>
reaction of nitrogen monoxide (NO) into nitrogen dioxide (NO2) <br>
through a compact gas reactor, and with the second step as the  <br>
FLU-ACE® tower for removing up to 98% of the nitrogen oxide <br>
(NO2), which is absorbed and dissolved into the water as nitrates <br>
that are non-hazardeous and can be recycled as a commercial <br>
fertilizer. When a wet scrubber is already present it can be used <br>
for NO2 removal, although conventional scruber technology is not  <br>
as efficient as the FLU-ACE for removing the NO2 in the second <br>
step.    <br>

                            The Hybrid FLU-ACE® system, currently being installed for <br>
combined  APC (PM) and HR from the exhaust gasses emitted by the <br>
iron castings operation Cupola process.<br>
<br>
The new Hybrid FLU-ACE® to recover 37 mmBtu/hr, and replace the <br>
existing Venturi scrubber for particulate removal - thereby <br>
eliminating over 1,000 HP of electrical power consumption<br>
<br>
The recovered heat will be used to supply continuous glycol <br>
heating to the fresh air make-up HVAC systems of the Truck Engine <br>
Plant.<br>
<br>
This FLU-ACE® installation will reduce the client&#39;s fossil fuel <br>
purchases in excess of $1 million annually. The reduced fuel <br>
consumption will also eliminate the discharge of more than:<br>
35 metric tons of Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) and more than 15,000 <br>
metric tons of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) each year <br>
<br>

Diversified wide spread application for more polluted waste gas <br>
streams emitted from industrial processes (ie. product dryers or <br>
waste fuel burning), cogeneration (ie. engine or turbine) coal <br>
fired process, wood or biomass burning process, desulfurisation, <br>
VOC from automobile manufacturing painting process exhausts or <br>
black liquor recovery boilers in pulp mill, removal or recovery <br>
of organic vapors in chemical industry, smelter exhausts, etc.<br>

                            FLU-ACE ® System is an effective and highly efficient air pollution control and waste heat recovery system using a direct-contact liquid-to-gas mass transfer and heat exchange concept.  FLU-ACE ® System is configured as a corrosion resistant alloy steel tower, a fraction the size of any existing stack.  All the hot flue gas from one source or multiple sources are re-directed into FLU-ACE ® tower where it is cooled to within 1-2°C of the primary water return temperature which enters the tower typically at 30°C/86°F to 40°C/104°F (depending on season).  <br>
<br>
The heat from flue gas is transferred to the primary water which then is at temperatures up to 63°C/145°F (and with special design, up to 82°C/180°F) and circulated to the various heat users.  It reduces air pollutant emissions by up to 99% and, at the same time, it recovers 80-90% of the heat in the flue gas presently exhausted into the atmosphere.  This results in reduction of fuel consumption of the facility by 15-25% depending on the fuel.  The system actually pays for itself within five years depending on energy prices, hours of operation and design complexity.<br>
<br>
The FLU-ACE ®/COGEN/Boiler System is designed to utilize all the recovered waste heat which results in generating electricity at prices from $0.02/kWh to $0.03/kWh.<br>

                            When compared with the Standard FLU-ACE ® System, HP FLU-ACE ® System and Hybrid FLU-ACE ® (suitable for wood chips, bark, wood waste, incineration, etc.) designed to process dirty flue gas and to dramatically reduce air pollutant emissions by 99%:<br>
<br>
Acid gases (i.e.  sulfur oxides) by over 95%  Particulate (i.e.  dust, soot, ash, etc.)  by up to 99% (down to 0.3 microns in size)  Halogenides (i.e.  HCl, HF, HBr) by up to 99%  Trace hydrocarbons (THC), organic toxins by 99%  VOCs by up to 99%  Noxious odours by up to 99%  Greenhouse gases (i.e.  carbon dioxide) by up to 50%  Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by 95%, nitrogen monoxide (NO) by 25% to 50%  Visible plume by 70-90%.<br>
   <br>
This exceeds all existing and meets even the strictest emission limits for incineration facilities and sets the standard for the future.  At the same time it recovers 80-90% of the heat in the flue gas presently exhausted into the atmosphere.  This results in reduction of energy consumption of gas and oil fuelled burners by 15-25% and in having more heat available for sale.<br>
  <br>
In effect, the capabilities of a Electro-static Precipitator, Scrubber, Waste Heat Recovery Unit and Smoke Stack are replaced with one FLU-ACE ® tower thus achieving significant savings in capital costs and operating and maintenance costs.  The energy savings from waste heat recovery enables the FLU-ACE ® System to pay for the control of the dirtiest flue gases.<br>
  <br>
The result was a high performance system which virtually eliminates air pollutant emissions from biomedical waste incinerators, while at the same time, paying for itself through energy recovery savings.  The HP FLU-ACE ® will capture and remove particulate (90-99%), SOx (over 95%), HCl, HF, and HBr (up to 99%), VOCs, and Patts (up to 99%).  HP FLU-ACE ® will effectively control emissions from &quot;dirty&quot; flue including municipal waste, biomedical waste, biomass, coal, hog fuel, and wood waste.  Similarly Hybrid FLU-ACE ® will effectively control emissions from bark, biomass, etc. combustion.<br>
  <br>
It recovers 3 to 4 times more heat than conventional indirect economizer systems.  It also provides large quantities of water for recycling.  Simple payback on capital investment is usually between three (3) and six (6) years, depending on the size, flue, operation time and design complexity, utilization of the recovered waste heat.<br>

                            A NO to NO2 converter unit is added to Standard FLU-ACE ® System to oxidize 95% of NO to obtain NO2.  As the Standard FLU-ACE ® System is designed to recover NO2 by 95%, the Low NOx FLU-ACE ® System will reduce NOx by  90%  and SOx still by over 95%.<br>
<br>
Operational cost and maintenance of the System is lower than the best Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) and Non-Selective Catalytic Reduction (NSCR) technologies.  Low NOx FLU-ACE ® System is 30-50% less expensive per ton of NOx removed than SCR or SNCR.<br>

FLU-ACE® cleans harmful air pollutants<br>
Reduced visible plume and public perception of pollution<br>
FLU-ACE® is the only heat recovery technology approved by the <br>
Ministry of Environment (MOE) to replace conventional stack as <br>
primary exhaust<br>
Lower retrofit capital cost due to MOE-approved (clean stack <br>
status) <br>
<br>
 The FLU-ACE® technology is an effective and highly efficient air <br>
pollution control and simultaneous waste heat recovery <br>
technology. <br>
Using a direct contact gas-to-liquid mass transfer and heat <br>
exchange concept, this system is designed to process flue gas <br>
from combustion of fossil fuels, waste derived fuels, waste, <br>
biomass, etc.<br>
<br>
The FLU-ACE® technology achieves air pollutant emission <br>
reductions by up to:<br>
<br>
 - 90% for Chemical Smog (NOx)<br>
 - 99% for Acid Rain (SOx)<br>
 - 99.9% for Hydrogen Halides (HCl, HF, HBr)<br>
 - 99% for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)<br>
 - 99.9% for Carcinogenic Compounds (Dioxins and Furans)<br>
 - 99% for Smog (THC)<br>
 - 99.9% for Particulate Matter (soot, ash, dust to 0.3 microns)<br>
 - 50% for Greenhouse Gases (CO2)<br>
 - 99.9% for Heavy Metals (Hg, As, Pb, etc.).<br>
<br>
In addition, the technology recovers 80% to 90% of the waste heat <br>
commonly wasted in the exhaust gas.  The recovered heat is then <br>
recycled into the process.  This generates energy savings which <br>
translates into fuel/money savings.  This effective air pollution <br>
control technology provides environmental compliance and energy <br>
conservation with economic payback.<br>

                            The LowNOx Process efficiently and cost effectively removes up to <br>
90% of NOx as both NO and NO2.  The LowNOx Process is a two-step <br>
process, with the first step as the gas phase chemical <br>
reaction of nitrogen monoxide (NO) into nitrogen dioxide (NO2) <br>
through a compact gas reactor, and with the second step as the  <br>
FLU-ACE® tower for removing up to 98% of the nitrogen oxide <br>
(NO2), which is absorbed and dissolved into the water as nitrates <br>
that are non-hazardeous and can be recycled as a commercial <br>
fertilizer. When a wet scrubber is already present it can be used <br>
for NO2 removal, although conventional scruber technology is not  <br>
as efficient as the FLU-ACE for removing the NO2 in the second <br>
step.    <br>

                            The Hybrid FLU-ACE® system, currently being installed for <br>
combined  APC (PM) and HR from the exhaust gasses emitted by the <br>
iron castings operation Cupola process.<br>
<br>
The new Hybrid FLU-ACE® to recover 37 mmBtu/hr, and replace the <br>
existing Venturi scrubber for particulate removal - thereby <br>
eliminating over 1,000 HP of electrical power consumption<br>
<br>
The recovered heat will be used to supply continuous glycol <br>
heating to the fresh air make-up HVAC systems of the Truck Engine <br>
Plant.<br>
<br>
This FLU-ACE® installation will reduce the client&#39;s fossil fuel <br>
purchases in excess of $1 million annually. The reduced fuel <br>
consumption will also eliminate the discharge of more than:<br>
35 metric tons of Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) and more than 15,000 <br>
metric tons of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) each year <br>

                            FLU-ACE ® System is an effective and highly efficient air pollution control and waste heat recovery system using a direct-contact liquid-to-gas mass transfer and heat exchange concept.  FLU-ACE ® System is configured as a corrosion resistant alloy steel tower, a fraction the size of any existing stack.  All the hot flue gas from one source or multiple sources are re-directed into FLU-ACE ® tower where it is cooled to within 1-2°C of the primary water return temperature which enters the tower typically at 30°C/86°F to 40°C/104°F (depending on season).  <br>
<br>
The heat from flue gas is transferred to the primary water which then is at temperatures up to 63°C/145°F (and with special design, up to 82°C/180°F) and circulated to the various heat users.  It reduces air pollutant emissions by up to 99% and, at the same time, it recovers 80-90% of the heat in the flue gas presently exhausted into the atmosphere.  This results in reduction of fuel consumption of the facility by 15-25% depending on the fuel.  The system actually pays for itself within five years depending on energy prices, hours of operation and design complexity.<br>
<br>
The FLU-ACE ®/COGEN/Boiler System is designed to utilize all the recovered waste heat which results in generating electricity at prices from $0.02/kWh to $0.03/kWh.<br>

                            When compared with the Standard FLU-ACE ® System, HP FLU-ACE ® System and Hybrid FLU-ACE ® (suitable for wood chips, bark, wood waste, incineration, etc.) designed to process dirty flue gas and to dramatically reduce air pollutant emissions by 99%:<br>
<br>
Acid gases (i.e.  sulfur oxides) by over 95%  Particulate (i.e.  dust, soot, ash, etc.)  by up to 99% (down to 0.3 microns in size)  Halogenides (i.e.  HCl, HF, HBr) by up to 99%  Trace hydrocarbons (THC), organic toxins by 99%  VOCs by up to 99%  Noxious odours by up to 99%  Greenhouse gases (i.e.  carbon dioxide) by up to 50%  Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by 95%, nitrogen monoxide (NO) by 25% to 50%  Visible plume by 70-90%.<br>
   <br>
This exceeds all existing and meets even the strictest emission limits for incineration facilities and sets the standard for the future.  At the same time it recovers 80-90% of the heat in the flue gas presently exhausted into the atmosphere.  This results in reduction of energy consumption of gas and oil fuelled burners by 15-25% and in having more heat available for sale.<br>
  <br>
In effect, the capabilities of a Electro-static Precipitator, Scrubber, Waste Heat Recovery Unit and Smoke Stack are replaced with one FLU-ACE ® tower thus achieving significant savings in capital costs and operating and maintenance costs.  The energy savings from waste heat recovery enables the FLU-ACE ® System to pay for the control of the dirtiest flue gases.<br>
  <br>
The result was a high performance system which virtually eliminates air pollutant emissions from biomedical waste incinerators, while at the same time, paying for itself through energy recovery savings.  The HP FLU-ACE ® will capture and remove particulate (90-99%), SOx (over 95%), HCl, HF, and HBr (up to 99%), VOCs, and Patts (up to 99%).  HP FLU-ACE ® will effectively control emissions from &quot;dirty&quot; flue including municipal waste, biomedical waste, biomass, coal, hog fuel, and wood waste.  Similarly Hybrid FLU-ACE ® will effectively control emissions from bark, biomass, etc. combustion.<br>
  <br>
It recovers 3 to 4 times more heat than conventional indirect economizer systems.  It also provides large quantities of water for recycling.  Simple payback on capital investment is usually between three (3) and six (6) years, depending on the size, flue, operation time and design complexity, utilization of the recovered waste heat.<br>

                            A NO to NO2 converter unit is added to Standard FLU-ACE ® System to oxidize 95% of NO to obtain NO2.  As the Standard FLU-ACE ® System is designed to recover NO2 by 95%, the Low NOx FLU-ACE ® System will reduce NOx by  90%  and SOx still by over 95%.<br>
<br>
Operational cost and maintenance of the System is lower than the best Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) and Non-Selective Catalytic Reduction (NSCR) technologies.  Low NOx FLU-ACE ® System is 30-50% less expensive per ton of NOx removed than SCR or SNCR.<br>

In combination with the Standard, HP, Hybrid, or any other FLU-ACE ® System the Low NOx FLU-ACE ® System will achieve 80-90% waste heat recovery.<br>

                            FLU-ACE ® System is an effective and highly efficient air pollution control and waste heat recovery system using a direct-contact liquid-to-gas mass transfer and heat exchange concept.  FLU-ACE ® System is configured as a corrosion resistant alloy steel tower, a fraction the size of any existing stack.  All the hot flue gas from one source or multiple sources are re-directed into one FLU-ACE ® tower where it is cooled to within 1-2 °C  of the primary water return temperature which enters the tower at between 30°C/86°F and 40°C/104°F (depending on season).  The heat from flue gas is transferred to the primary water which then is at temperatures up to 63°C/145°F (and with special design, up to 82°C/180°F) and circulates to the various heat users.<br>
<br>
Each FLU-ACE ® System is custom designed using proven technology to be integrated with the existing flue gas source.  No changes to the boilers (or other combustion equipment) or to the fuel are necessary.  Standard FLU-ACE ® System dramatically reduces air pollutant emissions by up to 99% specifically:<br>
<br>
Acid gases (i.e.  sulfur oxides) by over 95%  Particulate (i.e.  dust, soot, ash, etc.)  by up to 99%  Trace hydrocarbons (THC), organic toxins by 99%  VOCs by up to 99%  Noxious odours by up to 99%  Greenhouse gases (i.e.  carbon dioxide) by up to 50%  Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by 95%, nitrogen monoxide (NO) by 25% to 50%  Visible plume by 70-90%.<br>
<br>
ThIs exceeds all existing and meets even the strictest emission limits and sets the standard for the future.  At the same time and simultaneously it recovers over 80% and up to 90% of the heat in the flue gas presently exhausted into the atmosphere.  This results in reduction of energy consumption on gas and oil fuelled burners by 15-25%.  It recovers 3 to 4 times more heat than conventional indirect stact economizer systems.  It also provides large quantities of water for recycling.  Typical simple payback on capital  investment for installation of Standard FLU-ACE ® System is from two (2) to three (3)  years in continuous year round operations (i.e. industrial) and three (3) to five (5) years for institutional (i.e. university, hospital, etc.) application, depending on the type of flue gas, the size and design complexity.<br>

            Substantially smaller size<br>
FLU-ACE® cleans harmful air pollutants<br>
Reduced visible plume and public perception of pollution<br>
FLU-ACE® is the only heat recovery technology approved by the <br>
Ministry of Environment (MOE) to replace conventional stack as <br>
primary exhaust<br>
Lower retrofit capital cost due to MOE-approved (clean stack <br>
status) <br>
<br>
 The FLU-ACE® technology is an effective and highly efficient air <br>
pollution control and simultaneous waste heat recovery <br>
technology. <br>
Using a direct contact gas-to-liquid mass transfer and heat <br>
exchange concept, this system is designed to process flue gas <br>
from combustion of fossil fuels, waste derived fuels, waste, <br>
biomass, etc.<br>
<br>
The FLU-ACE® technology achieves air pollutant emission <br>
reductions by up to:<br>
<br>
 - 90% for Chemical Smog (NOx)<br>
 - 99% for Acid Rain (SOx)<br>
 - 99.9% for Hydrogen Halides (HCl, HF, HBr)<br>
 - 99% for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)<br>
 - 99.9% for Carcinogenic Compounds (Dioxins and Furans)<br>
 - 99% for Smog (THC)<br>
 - 99.9% for Particulate Matter (soot, ash, dust to 0.3 microns)<br>
 - 50% for Greenhouse Gases (CO2)<br>
 - 99.9% for Heavy Metals (Hg, As, Pb, etc.).<br>
<br>
In addition, the technology recovers 80% to 90% of the waste heat <br>
commonly wasted in the exhaust gas.  The recovered heat is then <br>
recycled into the process.  This generates energy savings which <br>
translates into fuel/money savings.  This effective air pollution <br>
control technology provides environmental compliance and energy <br>
conservation with economic payback.<br>
