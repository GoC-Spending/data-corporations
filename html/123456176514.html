We are totally committed to continue to live up to this reputation by focusing on innovation, customer service and strategic alliances with global partners who share our values.<br><br>PDI Management Seminars: <br>Great companies seed their success by relentlessly building talent. The management role has never been an easy one and it is more difficult in a rapidly changing and volatile business world. In the new and lean workplace, front-line professionals are entrusted with unprecedented responsibility. This means greater opportunities for achievers who can lead, seize the moment, master risks and get the best value out of their limited time. But the greatest opportunities do not come readily. Missed opportunities abound. Many intelligent and hard-working professionals lack the leadership skills essential for the current tough business world. <br><br>Armed with new expertise and entrepreneurial skills gained through our seminars, entrepreneurs, executives and professionals have expanded their horizon and created unprecedented business value for their respective organizations. Our aim is to continue to deliver the skill training required by our clients to compete and grow globally.<br><br>Harvard University Global System (HUGS): <br>Knowledge, technology and change are the seeds and levers for unparalleled opportunities.<br><br>HUGS Collection is a library of decision-support instruments (management road maps, posters, working forms and checklists for entrepreneurs, executives and professionals). It guarantees superior value to users when compared to current tools and technologies.<br><br>Harvard Road Maps are genuine management materiel based on extensive research and experience. They offer a proven template and practical methodology for preparing business plans, formulating a strategy, <br>managing risk and time and realizing goals. Both the laminated and the framed posters are so attractive, they can fit in a boardroom, a learning centers or an office. So far, four posters are available: From Vision and Strategy to Value Extraction (Business &amp; Government versions), Risk Management and Time Management. HUGS Management Templates speed-up the planning process and enhance the productivity of managers and professionals, be they tackling big-ticket items or day-to-day work. Subjected to extensive field tests, HUGS management templates are potent fact-finding tools to speed up &quot;days to market&quot; and rigorously investigate complex opportunities by making rewards and risks explicit. The Strategy Checkerboard is a creativity tool that helps users seek a complete panorama of strategic choices with less guesswork. It widens the window through which we view opportunities. With the Checkerboard, we can organize our thinking process and break down the barriers to innovation  at every step along the value chain. Even when the strategy is clear, its execution can be fraught with perils. That is why the tool also provides a step-by-step scenario to help users reduce implementation risk and reduce resistance to change.<br><br>The Negotiator mandate, Project Manager Charter and the Change Definition Grid provide the road map to establish a clear mandate with valid objectives and deliverables, adequate resources, verifiable performance indicators and a sound evaluation system. They include a framework to identify and manage risks related to the conditions beyond management control.<br><br>The Responsibility Chart helps users assign roles and accountability in a team. It mitigates the risks related to responsibility and veto and facilitates negotiation. It has been proven equally useful in preventing conflicts, managing transitions, reorganizations and job analysis.<br><br>The Harvard Time Log permits users to quickly analyze where their time goes. A comprehensive checklist helps them draw timesaving lessons and take corrective action. <br><br>HUGS Management Templates are the result of extensive research and are considered genuine innovations unmatched by competitors. In addition to these tools, a set of Harvard® work-saving Forms is also available for Meetings, Notes &amp; Tabular Reports, Client Contact, Communication, Action and Expense logs. <br><br>Harvard® Organizers, Planners, Calendars and Diaries:<br>Our patented planners and organizers currently marketed under the Harvard brand have brought substantial benefits to clients worldwide year after year. With its extensive international holiday grids by date and by country, the Harvard Planner is the ideal tool for managers and professionals with global connections and aspiring leaders in colleges and universities. The product line comes in three sizes (desk, medium and pocket), three bindings (book-bound and gilt edged, Wire-O, and refills for 3-, 6- and 7-ring binders) in English, French and bilingual versions. <br><br>Our proprietary software engine facilitates the creation of Harvard Planners in any western language. Developed in-house, this powerful system permits us to create a planner with the content and format selected by the client within a short notice. <br><br>The Touch of Harvard® Leather:<br>Until recently, our focus has been on improving the functionality of the Harvard Planners. We have created a small nucleus of leather covers and portfolios primarily to respond to demand from Harvard-Planner users. The exclusive quality of the portfolios and the Harvard brand appeal provide us with a unique value proposition to expand the leather product line and secure a niche in the growing market.<br><br>Books:<br>Each publication in this series addresses an important aspect of entrepreneurship and decision-making. <br><br>Book V40: Harnessing the Power of Intelligence, Counterintelligence &amp; Surprise Events<br>Full of practical illustrations and insights from business, government and the military, this seminal book covers the offensive and defensive functions of intelligence, their organization, leadership, tools and culture. It reveals new human intelligence instruments, platforms and breakthrough concepts to address the issues facing intelligence analysts, both at national and corporate levels. It can help companies use smart intelligence to win customers, team-up with selected allies, and shield their assets from competitors and other adversaries. Its focus is on detecting threats and opportunities, by legal and ethical means, and earlier than can be learned through reliable media and other intelligence sources. Readers will learn how to orchestrate and hitchhike on surprise events to create value.<br><br>The book is based on Harvard University Global System management road maps pioneered by the author Alain Paul Martin. It bring Martins intelligence framework to life and goes further by sharing hard-won lessons from experience in business and defense. For those who want to dig further, there are extensive endnotes, a multilingual bibliography, a series of recommended Web sites, a handy book index and two colorful Harvard road maps on strategy and risk. The book is designed to permit readers to refer to the intelligence framework and practical tips, time and time again.<br><br>The book is suitable for general audiences. Learning about intelligence can help each of us make wiser choices, work better and be a more informed citizen. New ideas are clearly presented and technical terms are explained thoroughly. Without being simplistic, the language is within the reach of corporate staff of all levels and functions. Some stories could be used to stimulate discussions and give college students a primer on intelligence. Numerous real-life examples about people, events, current affairs and important issues will be fun to read, talk about, both at work and at home. As Harvard Emeritus Professor William J. Bruns said: Martin has created a framework and processes that anyone or any organization can adapt and use to create information and intelligence that will prevent or reduce unpleasant surprises in their lives or work.<br><br>All in all, this is an excellent, timely and easy to read book with entertaining, vivid examples and breakthrough instruments, most of which are not available elsewhere. Highly recommended for managers, professionals and educators.<br><br>Book V27: Bringing Time to Life: 120 practical tips for managing your time and enjoying life<br>Time management is about doing a superior job the first time. This book bridges the gap between vision and daily practice. It offers 120 tips to make time for a better life where we can nurture our total growth  professional, spiritual, physical and emotional.<br><br>Book V25: Essence of a Proactive Life: 2 Practical Essays on Life &amp; Career Planning<br>&quot;Life Planning&quot;, the first essay, invites us to a candid self-examination which results in discovering those moments when we rejoice in life and find sources of lfillment. &quot;How to Stay Alive&quot;, the second essay, is an invaluable guide for change agents and offers eight principles on working with decision makers.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>Anticipating corporate needs... challenging leaders to gain the sharpest insights on business intelligence, innovation, strategic thinking, negotiation, project and time management providing decision makers with cutting-edge tools to build talent, select and retain the best customers, manage teams, communicate plans, track progress and grow business wherever they wish...that is the essence of our mission. Give us a try. We deliver. And thats the prelude to a lasting partnership. <br><br>HARVARD and HARVARD  UNIVERSITY are registered trademarks of President and Fellows of Harvard College. <br><br>HARVARD UNIVERSITY GLOBAL SYSTEM was developed by PDI independently of Harvard University and is distributed under trademark license.<br><br><br><br>

                            Great companies seed their success by relentlessly building <br>
talent. But, the management role has never been an easy one and <br>
it is more difficult in a rapidly changing and volatile business <br>
world. In the new and lean workplace, front-line professionals <br>
are entrusted with unprecedented responsibility. This means <br>
greater opportunities for achievers who can lead, seize the <br>
moment, master risks and get the best value out of their limited <br>
time. But the greatest opportunities do not come readily. Missed <br>
opportunities abound. Many intelligent and hard-working <br>
professionals lack the leadership skills essential for the <br>
current tough business world. <br>
<br>
Armed with new expertise and entrepreneurial skills gained <br>
through our seminars, entrepreneurs, executives and <br>
professionals have expanded their horizon and created <br>
unprecedented business value for their respective organizations. <br>
Our aim is to continue to deliver the skill training required by <br>
our clients to compete and grow globally.<br>
<br>
As an entrepreneurial niche organization, we must constantly <br>
reinvent ourselves. Our practical innovations aim at building <br>
world-class talent, validating strategy, mitigating risk, <br>
boosting productivity, improving decision making and <br>
facilitating world commerce. They capitalize on the best <br>
practices and cutting-edge knowledge on decision theory, ethical <br>
leadership and negotiation, change management, productivity, <br>
risk management, project management and IT. In project <br>
management, we cover project incubation and address the complete <br>
value-creation and extraction cycle. We are investing in R&amp;D to <br>
lead the market with an innovative framework, tools and <br>
software. We strive to become the partner of choice for leaders. <br>

with established distributors and manufacturer representatives <br>
to deliver premium quality products and software throughout the <br>
world.<br>
<br>

training and Harvard tools to improve the productivity and <br>
performance of every organization, regardless of its size and <br>
means. Affordable, Harvard- branded products are used in every <br>

education, publishing, media and defense). <br>
<br>
PDI delivers cutting-edge seminars on Strategy, Business <br>
Intelligence, Leadership and Negotiation, Risk, Project and Time <br>
Management. Tailoring in-house sessions to client needs is among <br>
our distinctive strengths. <br>

acceptance in large organizations. It offers a compelling <br>
approach with unique business benefits to users. In order to <br>
focus on development and exploit opportunities beyond our <br>
current direct-mailing market, we are teaming-up with <br>

<br>
3. Exceptional Rewards for You and Your Clients<br>
<br>
Excellent Commission and Growth Opportunities: Our distributors <br>
enjoy a high commission that grows substantially with volume. <br>
With a track record in client retention and traffic building, <br>
Harvard products are ideal for market share gains, cross selling <br>
and co-branding. <br>
Unique Training Benefits: We are committed to support our <br>
distributors with an advanced training program focusing on <br>
product knowledge, success stories and competitive intelligence <br>
to get and keep repeat-business customers. <br>
High-Premium Brand Benefits: Harvard brand is global in reach, <br>
highly esteemed; the product of centuries of value creation; <br>
currently untapped; Harvard can rival Tiffany, MontBlanc, <br>
Franklin and Day Timers anywhere. The Harvard Planner name brand <br>
is a familiar name to most people. The name recognition <br>
facilitates rapid introduction and high growth <br>
Undeniable and Transparent Selling Arguments: Harvard <br>
distributors are armed with powerful evidence-based selling <br>
arguments to promptly break resistance, build trust and convince <br>
prospects. As an illustration, an independent study by Ernst &amp; <br>
Young has proven that the Harvard Planner saves a user <br>
approximately 10 days per year. Not bad for a product retailing <br>
between $19 and $34 (Organizers from $109 to $149). The link to <br>
the Ernst &amp; Young study is: www.executive.org/EY <br>
Compelling Benefits to Your Clients: Our distributors have a <br>
distinct advantage over the competition. They can offer their <br>
clients special rates for participating in PDI world-class <br>
seminars on Risk Management, Negotiation, Time, Leadership, <br>
Strategy and Project Management.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Our Assets<br>
<br>
Innovation: We are continuously investing in R&amp;D to deliver the <br>
best and most productive Harvard products and software. <br>
Prestige Product Line of premium-quality products: Harvard <br>
Planners, Harvard management posters and Harvard University <br>
Global Software for decision makers and professionals. <br>
High Retention of Customers: Our products boast incredible brand <br>
loyalty. Our records show that once our clients have adopted one <br>
of our patented systems, they become loyal customers. This means <br>
that you only have to sell the planner once, and every year <br>
after that it sells itself. <br>
Strategic North-American Location and High-Production Capacity: <br>
We have perfected a robust production software. Our pre-press <br>
department is fully automated and we own an ultra-modern press <br>
facility located in a high-security building in a research park. <br>

with 26 years of business success. PDI has been debt free for <br>
over 10 consecutive years. Its operations can withstand high <br>
volatility and risk. <br>

                            Great companies seed their success by relentlessly building <br>
talent. But, the management role has never been an easy one and <br>
it is more difficult in a rapidly changing and volatile business <br>
world. In the new and lean workplace, front-line professionals <br>
are entrusted with unprecedented responsibility. This means <br>
greater opportunities for achievers who can lead, seize the <br>
moment, master risks and get the best value out of their limited <br>
time. But the greatest opportunities do not come readily. Missed <br>
opportunities abound. Many intelligent and hard-working <br>
professionals lack the leadership skills essential for the <br>
current tough business world. <br>
<br>
Armed with new expertise and entrepreneurial skills gained <br>
through our seminars, entrepreneurs, executives and <br>
professionals have expanded their horizon and created <br>
unprecedented business value for their respective organizations. <br>
Our aim is to continue to deliver the skill training required by <br>
our clients to compete and grow globally.<br>
<br>
As an entrepreneurial niche organization, we must constantly <br>
reinvent ourselves. Our practical innovations aim at building <br>
world-class talent, validating strategy, mitigating risk, <br>
boosting productivity, improving decision making and <br>
facilitating world commerce. They capitalize on the best <br>
practices and cutting-edge knowledge on decision theory, ethical <br>
leadership and negotiation, change management, productivity, <br>
risk management, project management and IT. In project <br>
management, we cover project incubation and address the complete <br>
value-creation and extraction cycle. We are investing in R&amp;D to <br>
lead the market with an innovative framework, tools and <br>
software. We strive to become the partner of choice for leaders. <br>

1. Why A Global Network of Harvard Distributors?<br>

performance track record. The market for Harvard-branded <br>
products and Harvard University software for decision makers <br>
exceeds 10 billion dollars worldwide. Our goal is to team up <br>
with established distributors and manufacturer representatives <br>
to deliver premium quality products and software throughout the <br>
world.<br>
<br>
2. Who Are We?<br>
We are the leading developer of productivity-improvement tools <br>
for managers and professionals in business and government. We <br>
produce patented Harvard Planners, Harvard Business Organizers, <br>
Harvard Wall Planners, Harvard University Global System (HUGS) <br>
and Software. HUGS Management Framework features the most <br>
practical and attractive road maps on risk management, strategy, <br>
time and project management.<br>
<br>
Characterized by unrivalled quality and high focus on <br>
innovation, PDI provides the most effective management skills <br>
training and Harvard tools to improve the productivity and <br>
performance of every organization, regardless of its size and <br>
means. Affordable, Harvard- branded products are used in every <br>
industry (IT, finance, transportation, health, biotech, <br>
education, publishing, media and defense). <br>
<br>
PDI delivers cutting-edge seminars on Strategy, Business <br>
Intelligence, Leadership and Negotiation, Risk, Project and Time <br>
Management. Tailoring in-house sessions to client needs is among <br>
our distinctive strengths. <br>
<br>

acceptance in large organizations. It offers a compelling <br>
approach with unique business benefits to users. In order to <br>
focus on development and exploit opportunities beyond our <br>
current direct-mailing market, we are teaming-up with <br>
established distributors.<br>
<br>
3. Exceptional Rewards for You and Your Clients<br>
<br>
Excellent Commission and Growth Opportunities: Our distributors <br>
enjoy a high commission that grows substantially with volume. <br>
With a track record in client retention and traffic building, <br>
Harvard products are ideal for market share gains, cross selling <br>
and co-branding. <br>
Unique Training Benefits: We are committed to support our <br>
distributors with an advanced training program focusing on <br>
product knowledge, success stories and competitive intelligence <br>
to get and keep repeat-business customers. <br>
High-Premium Brand Benefits: Harvard brand is global in reach, <br>
highly esteemed; the product of centuries of value creation; <br>
currently untapped; Harvard can rival Tiffany, MontBlanc, <br>
Franklin and Day Timers anywhere. The Harvard Planner name brand <br>
is a familiar name to most people. The name recognition <br>
facilitates rapid introduction and high growth <br>
Undeniable and Transparent Selling Arguments: Harvard <br>
distributors are armed with powerful evidence-based selling <br>
arguments to promptly break resistance, build trust and convince <br>
prospects. As an illustration, an independent study by Ernst &amp; <br>
Young has proven that the Harvard Planner saves a user <br>
approximately 10 days per year. Not bad for a product retailing <br>
between $19 and $34 (Organizers from $109 to $149). The link to <br>
the Ernst &amp; Young study is: www.executive.org/EY <br>
Compelling Benefits to Your Clients: Our distributors have a <br>
distinct advantage over the competition. They can offer their <br>
clients special rates for participating in PDI world-class <br>
seminars on Risk Management, Negotiation, Time, Leadership, <br>
Strategy and Project Management.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Our Assets<br>
<br>
Innovation: We are continuously investing in R&amp;D to deliver the <br>
best and most productive Harvard products and software. <br>
Prestige Product Line of premium-quality products: Harvard <br>
Planners, Harvard management posters and Harvard University <br>
Global Software for decision makers and professionals. <br>
High Retention of Customers: Our products boast incredible brand <br>
loyalty. Our records show that once our clients have adopted one <br>
of our patented systems, they become loyal customers. This means <br>
that you only have to sell the planner once, and every year <br>
after that it sells itself. <br>
Strategic North-American Location and High-Production Capacity: <br>
We have perfected a robust production software. Our pre-press <br>
department is fully automated and we own an ultra-modern press <br>
facility located in a high-security building in a research park. <br>
Financial Strength: With PDI, distributors have a solid partner <br>
with 26 years of business success. PDI has been debt free for <br>
over 10 consecutive years. Its operations can withstand high <br>
volatility and risk. <br>
