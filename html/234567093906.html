- increases personal and corporate accountability and productivity; <br>
- reduces stress in the workplace; <br>
- encourages retention of top talent; and <br>
- helps deliver high levels of service and customer retention<br>

                            Executive coaching is the latest tool in the progressive corporations arsenal for attracting and retaining top talent in this competitive global marketplace. Top tier performance is critical and todays leader is often without the support and objective feedback free of personal agenda and corporate politics. <br>
<br>
Develop fast-trackers and high performing leaders. Often executives need an objective, neutral sounding board to discuss challenges, opportunities and their perspective. Our coaches allow executives and managers to step away from their day-to-day routine and effectively strategize on how they can reach beyond where they are currently.<br>
<br>
Executive coaching is results oriented, completely confidential and can be customized to meet the unique needs of your corporation and industry. <br>

                            Our objective is to help you present a convincing case and persuade the decision-maker.<br>
<br>
Prior to the presentation, our experienced graphics professionals will consult with your team to create effective demonstratives that will connect with the decision-maker. Our graphics experts specialize in encapsulating complex evidence and presenting it in easy-to-understand concepts and images. Digitally preparing exhibits and rehearsing with your team allows us to ensure the presentation is accurate and convincing. We have done this successfully in many of North Americas largest cities in recent years.<br>
<br>
During the presentation, we&#39;ll provide support in the meeting room and work closely with your team. He will operate in the background, quietly running evidence presentation systems and displaying information on cue, so you can direct the audiences attention to the details of the presentation.<br>

                            Lunch and learn seminars	Organizations with healthy employees have a definite business advantage over their competition. The concept is easy. How to implement improved wellness within a company can be a challenge faced by your corporate wellness committee whenever they meet to discuss Health and Safety training and implementation. <br>
 <br>
How can your Health and Safety Committee inform employees about healthy habits so that they can perform with energy and enthusiasm at work? How can you attract employees who struggle with wellness issues and workplace stress as well as those who are already health oriented? Lunch and learn sessions are a great way to provide workplace training and inform employees of healthy ways to work<br>
and live.<br>

                            ive Behaviours of a Cohesive Team™ is the official training program based on the best-selling book, Five Dysfunctions of a Team and has a simple goal: To facilitate a learning experience that helps professionals and their organizations discover what it takes to build a truly cohesive and effective team. The central element of the training program is the DiSC-powered Five Behaviours personal profile, which guides teams towards better engagement and higher performance. The Five Behaviours profile, which provides both individual and team feedback, is grounded in the model described in The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, the internationally best-selling leadership fable by Patrick Lencioni.<br>
<br>
With this program, participants will learn how, as a team, they score on the key components of the model: trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results. Additionally, the program is powered by Everything DiSC®, a model that helps individuals to understand themselves and others better. Using these results, participants will be able to create a better, stronger team.<br>

              Aviva Shiff, a Certified Training and Etiquette Consultant, has become a frequent, popular and valued guest speaker here at Verity International. We are a nationwide Career Management and Organization Consulting firm. At our request she tailored one of her seminars, Building Business Relationships to Enhance Your Success to best supplement the coaching we provide our clients on networking as a prime job search methodology. Her professional yet warm demeanor in itself serves as a model to be emulated, and this, along with her polished facilitation and take away materials, continue to earn rave reviews from our clients.<br>
<br>
Based on our experience we would unhesitatingly recommend Aviva and Spark Training and Coaching Associates as excellent sources of training in Business Etiquette and related fields.<br>

<br>
&quot;If you do not know where you are going any road will do. Coaching has helped me to define where I want to go and how I want to get there.<br>
<br>
It has helped me gain insight in both my private and professional lives so I can achieve what matters most to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
-Carolyn Henderson <br>

<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks to personal coaching I&#39;m finally starting to knock down my self-imposed barriers and allowing myself to be open to the ever expanding opportunities that present themselves. I find my personality and character evolving constantly so that each day I&#39;m closer to becoming the person I know I can be.&quot;<br>
-D. Ascenzi <br>
Manager Compagnia Italiana Tourismo Tours <br>
<br>
Thank you so much for the leadership discovery journey you took me through. It has helped me enormously! <br>
<br>
Gaining a better understanding of my strengths and opportunities has improved my confidence as a leader and it has helped me determine where I want to grow from here. <br>
<br>
What I appreciate most about working with you is the fact that you really seem to understand my business needs and that you tailor the tools we use accordingly. So at the end of the day, I feel really clear about what I need to do to achieve my management objectives.<br>
<br>
I am very excited about the other programs you have to offer and I can see you becoming a valuable resource to me and my team in our pursuit of excellence. In the immediate term, I am really looking forward to your business etiquette course - which I think will provide very practical insights into how we can strengthen our relationships and interactions with our clients. <br>
<br>
Thanks again for your incredible insights, effort, and attention to detail. I look forward to working together in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>

                            Executive coaching is the latest tool in the progressive corporations arsenal for attracting and retaining top talent in this competitive global marketplace. Top tier performance is critical and todays leader is often without the support and objective feedback free of personal agenda and corporate politics. <br>
<br>
Develop fast-trackers and high performing leaders. Often executives need an objective, neutral sounding board to discuss challenges, opportunities and their perspective. Our coaches allow executives and managers to step away from their day-to-day routine and effectively strategize on how they can reach beyond where they are currently.<br>
<br>
Executive coaching is results oriented, completely confidential and can be customized to meet the unique needs of your corporation and industry. <br>

                            Our objective is to help you present a convincing case and persuade the decision-maker.<br>
<br>
Prior to the presentation, our experienced graphics professionals will consult with your team to create effective demonstratives that will connect with the decision-maker. Our graphics experts specialize in encapsulating complex evidence and presenting it in easy-to-understand concepts and images. Digitally preparing exhibits and rehearsing with your team allows us to ensure the presentation is accurate and convincing. We have done this successfully in many of North Americas largest cities in recent years.<br>
<br>
During the presentation, we&#39;ll provide support in the meeting room and work closely with your team. He will operate in the background, quietly running evidence presentation systems and displaying information on cue, so you can direct the audiences attention to the details of the presentation.<br>

                            Lunch and learn seminars	Organizations with healthy employees have a definite business advantage over their competition. The concept is easy. How to implement improved wellness within a company can be a challenge faced by your corporate wellness committee whenever they meet to discuss Health and Safety training and implementation. <br>
 <br>
How can your Health and Safety Committee inform employees about healthy habits so that they can perform with energy and enthusiasm at work? How can you attract employees who struggle with wellness issues and workplace stress as well as those who are already health oriented? Lunch and learn sessions are a great way to provide workplace training and inform employees of healthy ways to work<br>
and live.<br>

                            ive Behaviours of a Cohesive Team™ is the official training program based on the best-selling book, Five Dysfunctions of a Team and has a simple goal: To facilitate a learning experience that helps professionals and their organizations discover what it takes to build a truly cohesive and effective team. The central element of the training program is the DiSC-powered Five Behaviours personal profile, which guides teams towards better engagement and higher performance. The Five Behaviours profile, which provides both individual and team feedback, is grounded in the model described in The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, the internationally best-selling leadership fable by Patrick Lencioni.<br>
<br>
With this program, participants will learn how, as a team, they score on the key components of the model: trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results. Additionally, the program is powered by Everything DiSC®, a model that helps individuals to understand themselves and others better. Using these results, participants will be able to create a better, stronger team.<br>

              Aviva Shiff, a Certified Training and Etiquette Consultant, has become a frequent, popular and valued guest speaker here at Verity International. We are a nationwide Career Management and Organization Consulting firm. At our request she tailored one of her seminars, Building Business Relationships to Enhance Your Success to best supplement the coaching we provide our clients on networking as a prime job search methodology. Her professional yet warm demeanor in itself serves as a model to be emulated, and this, along with her polished facilitation and take away materials, continue to earn rave reviews from our clients.<br>
<br>
Based on our experience we would unhesitatingly recommend Aviva and Spark Training and Coaching Associates as excellent sources of training in Business Etiquette and related fields.<br>

-W. Allan Methven <br>
Vice President, Verity International Limited Toronto, Ontario <br>
<br>
&quot;If you do not know where you are going any road will do. Coaching has helped me to define where I want to go and how I want to get there.<br>
<br>
It has helped me gain insight in both my private and professional lives so I can achieve what matters most to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
-Carolyn Henderson <br>
IT Services Manager, Toronto <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks to personal coaching I&#39;m finally starting to knock down my self-imposed barriers and allowing myself to be open to the ever expanding opportunities that present themselves. I find my personality and character evolving constantly so that each day I&#39;m closer to becoming the person I know I can be.&quot;<br>
-D. Ascenzi <br>
Manager Compagnia Italiana Tourismo Tours <br>
<br>
Thank you so much for the leadership discovery journey you took me through. It has helped me enormously! <br>
<br>
Gaining a better understanding of my strengths and opportunities has improved my confidence as a leader and it has helped me determine where I want to grow from here. <br>
<br>
What I appreciate most about working with you is the fact that you really seem to understand my business needs and that you tailor the tools we use accordingly. So at the end of the day, I feel really clear about what I need to do to achieve my management objectives.<br>
<br>
I am very excited about the other programs you have to offer and I can see you becoming a valuable resource to me and my team in our pursuit of excellence. In the immediate term, I am really looking forward to your business etiquette course - which I think will provide very practical insights into how we can strengthen our relationships and interactions with our clients. <br>
<br>
Thanks again for your incredible insights, effort, and attention to detail. I look forward to working together in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>

President, Rand Research Corporation, Toronto <br>
