              <h4>
                Unique applications:
              </h4>
           
              Several features set Safety Bath walk in bathtubs apart from similar products on the market. Safety Bath&#39;s Serenity is a compact walk in bathtub which, due to the outward door swing, uses less water and is therefore faster to fill and drain than larger products on the market. In addition Safety Bath models feature very low step in heights.   <br>
<br>
Safety Bath Supreme is an institutional bathtub designed to fill the void in care home and assisted living facilities for those individuals whose mobility will allow them to walk in to a bathtub to be bathed. The compact appearance of the Supreme makes it less threatening to clients than a lift tub and its design offers line of sight dignity to the user who lives in an institutional setting but can still retain some independence in bathing.<br>
The Suprem features the hygienic 12 jet San-Air system which eliminates the risk of bacterial contamination when multiple users access the same bathtub. A sanitizing system is included.  The Safety Bath Supreme measures 34 W x 40 L x 30H, its size making it less expensive than traditional institutional lift tubs to operate since it requires less water, fills faster and requires less sanitizing chemical than a traditional lift bathtub. Caregivers find that the Supreme is easy to use and reduces the risk of caregiver injury. <br>
In April, 2006 Safety Bath Inc. unveiled the Safety Bath So-Lo and the So-Lo with Shower Seat. The So-Lo series was designed to meet the demands of the construction industry as well as the changing needs of the aging baby boomer generation. The So-Lo measures 31W (43 W with optional shower seat) 59L and 18H. Both models feature an inward swing door and low entry step to allow the user to enter safely and easily, accommodating those who want to bathe or shower.  The So-Lo with Shower Seat offers a heated seat where the user can sit to shower when tired or unable to stand. The Safety Bath So-Lo and So-Lo with Shower Seat are designed to provide for aging in place.<br>
Safety Bath Inc. has recently rounded out its product line by offering the Door Insert Kit which can be inserted into a traditional bathtub to allow the user to convert an existing bathtub into a bathtub with a door.   While it is common to cut out an opening in a bathtub to permit accessibility the Door Insert Kit goes one step further by permitting accessible entrance without losing the use of the bathtub.  The Door Insert Kit is revolutionizing the bathtub industry for aging baby boomers and others who want to remain in their home as long as possible. The Door Kit will provide accessibility without complete bathroom renovation  The Kit is available in a range of sizes to accommodate most bathtubs.  The Door Insert Kit must be installed by a qualified installation expert.<br>
<br>
 partner to the Door Insert Kit, the Universal Safety Seat can be installed together with the Door Insert Kit or as an independent component.  The Universal Safety Seat is available in a number of custom sizes to fit virtually any bathtub.  Constructed of high density polyethylene with a weight capacity of 350 lbs, the Safety Seat can be folded up when not in use and attaches securely to a wall mounted retaining bracket. The Universal Safety Seat allows the user to sit if tired while showering or can be used in placed of a bath chair often set within the bathtub.<br>

              Luther Care Communities in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has been fortunate in being able to provide Safety Baths for many of the clients in our facilities.

              As the need grows for home renovations that will allow the home owner to age in place, one small contractor transforms a 4 x 10 space into a dream bathroom.  The bathroom, which focuses around a walk in bathtub, will accommodate the changing mobility needs of the homeowner.  With for the project comparable to a standard bathroom reno, a retired will be able to maintain independence for years to come.<br>
<br>
How One Contractor Became His Customers Hero<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Contractor Steve Francey transforms a small space in a retired couples home into the bathroom of their dreams to accommodate their limited mobility for about the same cost as a standard bathroom. <br>
<br>
<br>
Statistics Canada predicts that, by 2031, the number of Canadians aged 65 and over will approach 10 million. To accommodate their desire to remain in their homes, we will see an influx in demand to renovate their homes so they can age in place. <br>
For Steve Francey of S. Francey Home Improvements, a significant proportion of his business, which is based in Ontarios Durham Region, already reflects the increase in the need for aging homeowners to alter their homes and life style to facilitate changes in health and limited mobility. Though, in the beginning, it happened more by chance than by choice, Francey is building a niche for himself and finds this aging population wants to stay in their homes and remain close to friends and family in a familiar community with their healthcare services near by. The only way thats going to happen is if we can modify their homes to make them more functional and accessible.<br>
	Recently, Francey was asked to take a 4- by 10-ft. space at the end of a sun room to create a practical and functional bathroom for a senior couple with limited mobility and tight budget. This couple lived in a small bungalow in a residential retirement community. There was only a crawl space under their house and no access to the shallow attic. They needed a bathroom designed to accommodate the husbands limited mobility and progressive loss of balance caused by Parkinsons disease. The wife wanted her husband to retain his independence for as long as possible, so designing a bathroom with fixtures to meet their needs and budget was a tall order. But, with Franceys enthusiasm, he tackled the challenge and began his search for the needed bathroom solutions. <br>
<br>
Preparing for special needs<br>
	First, Francey visited wheelchair accessible facilities to see what kinds of devices and products institutions install for their long-term care patients. He insisted on meeting the husbands occupational therapist and discussing what kind of support devices were needed and how they were to be positioned on the bathroom walls. He collected online literature on wheelchair accessible standards for housing and building renovations. He visited wholesalers and trade shows to see the newest technologies and products available. He collected product brochures, spent his evenings searching the Internet for additional information and options that would help him create a bathroom that his customer said, Must not look like a hospital room.<br>
	This is not a contractors typical approach to a renovation project, but there are no precedents for this new and growing field except those you develop for yourself, says Francey. For me, this isnt just a job. I get tremendous satisfaction from trying new things, learning the latest techniques, testing materials Ive never used before, but most of all, watching my customers faces light up with appreciation when they see the result. Oh yeah, and getting that hug.<br>
	Next, he examined the physical space to find out what problems he might face before installing the plumbing, ventilation and the electrical services. He needed to know whether the crawl space underneath was adequately heated and dry, or if mould had invaded somewhere.<br>
	In a room this size, most contractors wouldnt consider installing a tub. They would either customize a shower stall four feet by 32 inches or buy a 36 by 36-inch preformed shower. But, neither suited Franceys homeowners. After much searching and questioning, he created a base plan incorporating products he decided would work best in the small narrow space. <br>
<br>
What bath tub was selected for this project and why<br>
For this project, a walk-in tub was the best solution, and the dimensions of Safety Baths Serenity model were perfect30 inches high, 36 inches from front to back and 34 inches wide. Other comparisons also made the Serenity tub ideally suited for this installation as the Serenity:<br>
	Holds same amount of water as a regular bathtub; larger ones may need a larger water heater because of greater capacity;<br>
	Fills faster and drains faster than larger competitors;<br>
	Fits into small spaces like a laundry room or even a closet, if necessary;<br>
	Has a wider door that swings outward for easier entrymany competitors tubs Francey considered are designed with a narrow door that opens inward, and this could prevent you from quickly removing someone in an emergency;<br>
	Has the lowest step in the industry because the tub floor is only two inches above the house floor, while most other walk-in tubs have a seven-inch step;<br>
	Is available as a soaker bathub, with 4 jet hydro-therapy action or 12 jet warm air massage and an optional heated seat.  Hydro-therapy has been shown as beneficial  in helping  people with circulatory problems, arthritis and sore muscles;<br>
	Weighs 120 pounds and is Canadian made from durable, easy-to-care-for fibreglass versus the heavier steel used in some imports;<br>
	Accommodates and is primarily designed for the limited mobility of people using walkerswheelchair users require a lift device;<br>
	Comes complete with pop-up drain valve and a removable booster seat. Optional MOEN pressure-balanced, scald-guard taps and MOEN hand-held shower are provided if desired.<br>
<br>
For Francey, using new products like the Safety Bath allowed him to learn as he worked. Trying something new can be intimidating, but Safety Baths Serenity walk-in tub came with a template, easy-to-follow instructions and a demo DVD, plus Safety Baths telephone support line. Safety Bath made it really easy to install.<br>
<br>
<br>
Franceys Recommendations for a Successful Accessible Living Renovation Project<br>
<br>
	Consider your customers mobility problems, challenges and consider their safety<br>
	Be respectful and consider your customers emotional state<br>
	Check for structural problems in the existing space<br>
	Have a base plan<br>
	Work with your customer and their occupational therapist to create a functional design for the project<br>
	Expect and accept change <br>
	Use products that best fit their needs, be willing and open to learning new about new products, technologies and techniques<br>
	Ensure modifications are functional, affordable and provide enjoyment of use<br>
	Provide quality workmanship which contributes to the homeowners equity<br>
	Avoid disrupting customers daily life as much as possible<br>
	Keep their home and your work area tidy<br>
	Make finished area blend with homes décor<br>
	Take pride in yourself and your workmanship <br>

                Unique applications:
              </h4>
           
              Several features set Safety Bath walk in bathtubs apart from similar products on the market. Safety Bath&#39;s Serenity is a compact walk in bathtub which, due to the outward door swing, uses less water and is therefore faster to fill and drain than larger products on the market. In addition Safety Bath models feature very low step in heights.   <br>
<br>
Safety Bath Supreme is an institutional bathtub designed to fill the void in care home and assisted living facilities for those individuals whose mobility will allow them to walk in to a bathtub to be bathed. The compact appearance of the Supreme makes it less threatening to clients than a lift tub and its design offers line of sight dignity to the user who lives in an institutional setting but can still retain some independence in bathing.<br>
The Suprem features the hygienic 12 jet San-Air system which eliminates the risk of bacterial contamination when multiple users access the same bathtub. A sanitizing system is included.  The Safety Bath Supreme measures 34 W x 40 L x 30H, its size making it less expensive than traditional institutional lift tubs to operate since it requires less water, fills faster and requires less sanitizing chemical than a traditional lift bathtub. Caregivers find that the Supreme is easy to use and reduces the risk of caregiver injury. <br>
In April, 2006 Safety Bath Inc. unveiled the Safety Bath So-Lo and the So-Lo with Shower Seat. The So-Lo series was designed to meet the demands of the construction industry as well as the changing needs of the aging baby boomer generation. The So-Lo measures 31W (43 W with optional shower seat) 59L and 18H. Both models feature an inward swing door and low entry step to allow the user to enter safely and easily, accommodating those who want to bathe or shower.  The So-Lo with Shower Seat offers a heated seat where the user can sit to shower when tired or unable to stand. The Safety Bath So-Lo and So-Lo with Shower Seat are designed to provide for aging in place.<br>
Safety Bath Inc. has recently rounded out its product line by offering the Door Insert Kit which can be inserted into a traditional bathtub to allow the user to convert an existing bathtub into a bathtub with a door.   While it is common to cut out an opening in a bathtub to permit accessibility the Door Insert Kit goes one step further by permitting accessible entrance without losing the use of the bathtub.  The Door Insert Kit is revolutionizing the bathtub industry for aging baby boomers and others who want to remain in their home as long as possible. The Door Kit will provide accessibility without complete bathroom renovation  The Kit is available in a range of sizes to accommodate most bathtubs.  The Door Insert Kit must be installed by a qualified installation expert.<br>
<br>
 partner to the Door Insert Kit, the Universal Safety Seat can be installed together with the Door Insert Kit or as an independent component.  The Universal Safety Seat is available in a number of custom sizes to fit virtually any bathtub.  Constructed of high density polyethylene with a weight capacity of 350 lbs, the Safety Seat can be folded up when not in use and attaches securely to a wall mounted retaining bracket. The Universal Safety Seat allows the user to sit if tired while showering or can be used in placed of a bath chair often set within the bathtub.<br>

              Luther Care Communities in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan has been fortunate in being able to provide Safety Baths for many of the clients in our facilities.  We are very happy with the product.  It allows for safe and independent bathing.

              As the need grows for home renovations that will allow the home owner to age in place, one small contractor transforms a 4 x 10 space into a dream bathroom.  The bathroom, which focuses around a walk in bathtub, will accommodate the changing mobility needs of the homeowner.  With for the project comparable to a standard bathroom reno, a retired will be able to maintain independence for years to come.<br>
<br>
How One Contractor Became His Customers Hero<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Contractor Steve Francey transforms a small space in a retired couples home into the bathroom of their dreams to accommodate their limited mobility for about the same cost as a standard bathroom. <br>
<br>
<br>
Statistics Canada predicts that, by 2031, the number of Canadians aged 65 and over will approach 10 million. To accommodate their desire to remain in their homes, we will see an influx in demand to renovate their homes so they can age in place. <br>
For Steve Francey of S. Francey Home Improvements, a significant proportion of his business, which is based in Ontarios Durham Region, already reflects the increase in the need for aging homeowners to alter their homes and life style to facilitate changes in health and limited mobility. Though, in the beginning, it happened more by chance than by choice, Francey is building a niche for himself and finds this aging population wants to stay in their homes and remain close to friends and family in a familiar community with their healthcare services near by. The only way thats going to happen is if we can modify their homes to make them more functional and accessible.<br>
	Recently, Francey was asked to take a 4- by 10-ft. space at the end of a sun room to create a practical and functional bathroom for a senior couple with limited mobility and tight budget. This couple lived in a small bungalow in a residential retirement community. There was only a crawl space under their house and no access to the shallow attic. They needed a bathroom designed to accommodate the husbands limited mobility and progressive loss of balance caused by Parkinsons disease. The wife wanted her husband to retain his independence for as long as possible, so designing a bathroom with fixtures to meet their needs and budget was a tall order. But, with Franceys enthusiasm, he tackled the challenge and began his search for the needed bathroom solutions. <br>
<br>
Preparing for special needs<br>
	First, Francey visited wheelchair accessible facilities to see what kinds of devices and products institutions install for their long-term care patients. He insisted on meeting the husbands occupational therapist and discussing what kind of support devices were needed and how they were to be positioned on the bathroom walls. He collected online literature on wheelchair accessible standards for housing and building renovations. He visited wholesalers and trade shows to see the newest technologies and products available. He collected product brochures, spent his evenings searching the Internet for additional information and options that would help him create a bathroom that his customer said, Must not look like a hospital room.<br>
	This is not a contractors typical approach to a renovation project, but there are no precedents for this new and growing field except those you develop for yourself, says Francey. For me, this isnt just a job. I get tremendous satisfaction from trying new things, learning the latest techniques, testing materials Ive never used before, but most of all, watching my customers faces light up with appreciation when they see the result. Oh yeah, and getting that hug.<br>
	Next, he examined the physical space to find out what problems he might face before installing the plumbing, ventilation and the electrical services. He needed to know whether the crawl space underneath was adequately heated and dry, or if mould had invaded somewhere.<br>
	In a room this size, most contractors wouldnt consider installing a tub. They would either customize a shower stall four feet by 32 inches or buy a 36 by 36-inch preformed shower. But, neither suited Franceys homeowners. After much searching and questioning, he created a base plan incorporating products he decided would work best in the small narrow space. <br>
<br>
What bath tub was selected for this project and why<br>
For this project, a walk-in tub was the best solution, and the dimensions of Safety Baths Serenity model were perfect30 inches high, 36 inches from front to back and 34 inches wide. Other comparisons also made the Serenity tub ideally suited for this installation as the Serenity:<br>
	Holds same amount of water as a regular bathtub; larger ones may need a larger water heater because of greater capacity;<br>
	Fills faster and drains faster than larger competitors;<br>
	Fits into small spaces like a laundry room or even a closet, if necessary;<br>
	Has a wider door that swings outward for easier entrymany competitors tubs Francey considered are designed with a narrow door that opens inward, and this could prevent you from quickly removing someone in an emergency;<br>
	Has the lowest step in the industry because the tub floor is only two inches above the house floor, while most other walk-in tubs have a seven-inch step;<br>
	Is available as a soaker bathub, with 4 jet hydro-therapy action or 12 jet warm air massage and an optional heated seat.  Hydro-therapy has been shown as beneficial  in helping  people with circulatory problems, arthritis and sore muscles;<br>
	Weighs 120 pounds and is Canadian made from durable, easy-to-care-for fibreglass versus the heavier steel used in some imports;<br>
	Accommodates and is primarily designed for the limited mobility of people using walkerswheelchair users require a lift device;<br>
	Comes complete with pop-up drain valve and a removable booster seat. Optional MOEN pressure-balanced, scald-guard taps and MOEN hand-held shower are provided if desired.<br>
<br>
For Francey, using new products like the Safety Bath allowed him to learn as he worked. Trying something new can be intimidating, but Safety Baths Serenity walk-in tub came with a template, easy-to-follow instructions and a demo DVD, plus Safety Baths telephone support line. Safety Bath made it really easy to install.<br>
<br>
<br>
Franceys Recommendations for a Successful Accessible Living Renovation Project<br>
<br>
	Consider your customers mobility problems, challenges and consider their safety<br>
	Be respectful and consider your customers emotional state<br>
	Check for structural problems in the existing space<br>
	Have a base plan<br>
	Work with your customer and their occupational therapist to create a functional design for the project<br>
	Expect and accept change <br>
	Use products that best fit their needs, be willing and open to learning new about new products, technologies and techniques<br>
	Ensure modifications are functional, affordable and provide enjoyment of use<br>
	Provide quality workmanship which contributes to the homeowners equity<br>
	Avoid disrupting customers daily life as much as possible<br>
	Keep their home and your work area tidy<br>
	Make finished area blend with homes décor<br>
	Take pride in yourself and your workmanship <br>
