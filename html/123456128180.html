SEMINAR:  INSIGHTS INTO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, ENGAGEMENT &amp; TEAMWORK <br>
<br>
This One-Day (or One-On-One Coaching) Diagnostics Based Program on INSIGHTS INTO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, ENGAGEMENT &amp; TEAMWORK will be customized to meet the specific needs of your team. <br>
<br>
A detailed, TWO part 53-54 page narrative description, along with the Insights wheel, is generated from the individual&#39;s responses to the Insights Analysis online diagnostics questionnaire.  The reports are extremely comprehensive and astonishingly revealing, providing positive input and action ideas for maximum performance and goal achievement.  <br>
<br>
•	Part one focuses on BEHAVIORS.   It provides the tools for understanding and appreciating differences in people. <br>
•	Part two focuses MOTIVATORS and VALUES, the WHY behind your behavior and actions.<br>
<br>
We use two personality profile systems to fast-track learning an effective communication language. These systems fit perfectly with Myers-Briggs and multiply the benefits of that or similar investments. You will learn to Understand and Appreciate Differences in People through a visual representation of eight behavioral styles and six motivators/values/attitudes that drive behavior. <br>
<br>
Imagine a time and place where everyone in your organization shares a common language. Imagine a language which allows them to communicate more effectively 24/7, with customers, colleagues and family. Imagine having a language which helps them to recognize and value the contributions that each individual can make. A language which makes personal development, empowerment and team centered leadership a way of life. Our journey will take you to a place where all of these things are possible. <br>
<br>
Managers and human resource professionals worldwide are using these amazing tools. The Insights program, through its unique link between the latest computer software and a model of relationships unparalleled in simplicity, offers great depth and goes further than ever before in meeting interpersonal challenges. <br>
<br>
The research behind Insights draws upon the most fundamental and tested concepts in the area of understanding how people function. <br>
<br>
The Success INSIGHTS WHEEL demonstrates the differences between persons Natural Style, Adapted Style and Work Environment. In addition, when profiling a team, the DISC practitioner can see the team’s behavioral composition and potential conflicts at a glance with the Wheel. <br>
<br>
The integration of the Success Insights Wheel into your business or department will build your credibility as well as increase your knowledge of observable human behavior. Here’s what a PWGSC Regional Director says: It’s magic when you get it right. All in all, Insights was the best session of its kind that I have attended. While things like Myers-Briggs are of some value, this program provided very practical application. Mark Harrison, Regional Director, Public Works Gov’t Services Canada <br>
<br>

PERFORM AT YOUR BEST - EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS <br>
<br>
Keys to Peak Performance, Personal Leadership &amp; Effective Engagement - Three Day Program. <br>
<br>
TESTIMONIAL:  &quot;This seminar has taken all the best training tools available and pulled them together in the most dynamic way I have ever experienced. It is exceptional and should be the foundation of every company’s vision.” Training Manager, Canada Post Corporation, Winnipeg <br>
<br>
THREE Earlier versions of this multimedia program by Brian Tracy were called: The Psychology of Achievement; The Phoenix Seminar and Maximum Achievement Seminar. This up-dated program provides almost all of the skills asked for in the Employability Skills Profile provided by the Conference Board of Canada. <br>
<br>
Why are some people more successful and more fulfilled than others? Why are only a minority of employees “fully engaged” in most organizations today? These questions have been studied by the greatest thinkers throughout the ages. This program is designed to give individuals the strategies, methods and practical  “How to” techniques practiced by the most successful, happy, and productive - engaged people in our society. <br>
<br>
•	TESTIMONIAL:  “It has been 3 1/2 years of self discovery and untold awakenings since I attended your Seminar. Over my 24-year government career, I attended a number of self-improvement courses. This course, by far, was worth more than the rest combined. There are times in one’s life when “thanks” just isn’t good enough, and this is one of them. The seminar changed my life and I thank you for that.” E K, PWGSC <br>
•	As many of our graduates have said…“This seminar was worth more than any year I spent at university. It&#39;s helping to make all my other learning work more effectively. It provided many of the missing &#39;soft - people skills&#39; I needed!” <br>
<br>
ESSENTIAL SKILLS <br>
<br>
All personal and professional skills learning fits into TWO basic categories and both are Essential Skills for career success <br>
<br>
1. Technical Skills:  These skills are very essential for career success, but are only 5-20% of the skills needed for lifelong employability. Those who have excellent technical skills but lack the People Factor Skills are often fired or wished away. <br>
<br>
2. Personal Management Skills for Effective Engagement:  Attitude: From 80-95% of career/life success depends on these “attitude skills” for engagement. These Personal Management Skills are also referred to as “soft skills”, “life skills”, “employability skills”…summarized in one word it’s all about “attitude”! While these skills are generally not provided in our educational institutions, they can be learned rapidly through the programs we provide! <br>
<br>
<br>
THE SOLUTION FOR CREATING AN ENGAGED WORKFORCE <br>

The Perform at Your Best - Employability Skills Seminar is a fast-track program designed to give you the strategies, methods and specific tools &amp; techniques practiced by the most balanced, successful, happy and productive service oriented people in our society. <br>

<br>
The Perform at Your Best Seminar has been shared with more than one million people all over the world. Tens of thousands of people in some of the biggest and best corporations and government departments have been through this program and ranked it as &quot;the finest seminar on personal and professional development ever created&quot;. <br>

•	“This will have a profound impact on my personal and professional life.

I firmly believe that this seminar is absolutely mandatory for all people I work with!” KS, Regional Manager, Asset Management, RCMP <br>
•	“This was a powerful seminar, which I enjoyed tremendously. It has left me excited as I apply the many ideas and principles taught to both my personal and professional life.  “This course is truly one of the best I have attended and I enthusiastically recommend it to all Health Canada employees. This seminar would enhance their performance at work and increase their personal growth by empowering them to make positive choices and decisions in all aspects of their lives. The outcome for Health Canada would be the ultimate employee wellness program resulting in higher employee morale, a more solidified team spirit and an increase of productivity in each department.  The feedback from the other participants who attended this seminar has also been very positive and has reinforced my belief that all of Health Canada and its employees would benefit from this course.” DC, Director, Finance &amp; Admin., Health Canada <br>
<br>
ATTITUDE - By Charles Swindoll <br>
<br>
The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company a home. <br>
<br>
The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past, we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. <br>
<br>
I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I respond to it. <br>

            Our training programs effectively combine lectures, team activities, group discussions, and assessments to help people discover their own strengths and weaknesses.  Our workshops are highly enjoyable and participative.  <br>
<br>
For the Insights programs each participant receives a comprehensive personal computerized report on his or her personal team preferences, along with course notes, exercises and reference materials for follow-up purposes, plus a graduation certificate!<br>
<br>
In the other Multi-Media programs listed,  we provide workbooks and CDs for followup and review.<br>

              &quot;The Maximum Achievement Seminar has taken all the best training tools available and pulled them together in the most dynamic way I have ever experienced. It is exceptional and should be the foundation of every companys vision.   Pat Sylvester, Training Manager, Canada Post Corporation, Winnipeg<br>
<br>
Most important personal development training that I have undertaken in the past 20+ years.  The best and most valuable ideas that I will apply are to eliminate destructive criticism and negative statements; set personal goals daily and set meaningful deadlines; daily affirmations  daily challenge to make myself even more valuable and take responsibility, take action.  Neil was absolutely professional, excellent.  Tremendous!  Gut wrenching!                        Richard Sweet, Manager, Technical Services, CPC<br>
<br>
 The Maximum Achievement Seminar opened my eyes, and changed my life! I had become someone who was ungrateful for his job and nowIm applying to become a supervisor, a supervisor like the one who gave me the gift of Maximum Achievement.                          Craig Anaka, Canada Post Corporation<br>
<br>
My hope and dream is that eventually all Health Canada employees in our Region (including the Regional Executive Committee) attend the Seminar.  In the short term, I see enormous benefits in having at minimum those working in Human Resources attend.  It will be one of the greatest investments (both time and financially) we will ever make for our people.     Howard Berg, Manager,                                                                Learning, Careers, Diversity Services at Health Canada <br>
<br>
 This was by far the best seminar that I have attended in my twenty-one years with RCMP. With uncommon practicality the seminar leaves participants transformed, ready and committed to a dramatic change in attitude in their personal as well as professional life.   Tom Wieclawski, Manager, Learning Technology and Creative Services <br>
<br>
Everyone, managers, workers, spouses should go through this at least once, preferably early in their career or life. It really opened my eyes about myself. Thank You.                                              		  Ken Doege, Mechanical Maintenance Technician<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been three and a half years of self discovery and untold awakenings since I attended your Phoenix Seminar.  Over my 24-year government career, I attended a number of self-improvement courses.  This course, by far, was worth more than the rest combined.   There are times in one&#39;s life when &quot;thanks&quot; just isn&#39;t good enough, and this is one of them.  The seminar changed my life and I thank you for that.&quot;     	Ed Klemm, PWGSC<br>
<br>
 This will have a profound impact on my personal and professional life.  I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing me how to remove the clouds and allow me to see clearly the impacts that I have had and can haveat home and at work.  I firmly believe that this seminar is absolutely mandatory for all people I work with!   Kevin Serle, Regional Manager, Asset Management, RCMP<br>
<br>
Insights Testimonials by PWGSC Managers<br>
<br>
Since attending the Insights Seminar in September 2008, I have found myself going back several times to read over my profile, and the general characteristics of the other groups.  This has proven helpful both at work and amongst family and friends.  Overall, I have found the Insights Seminar material very useful as a &quot;self-examining&quot; resource.                     Dan McRuer, PWGSC Acting Supply Specialist<br>
<br>
 Thank you for the Insights Seminar experience. Not only is the information fun, it has proven to be useful, especially at work.   Thank you again for the work you do and for sharing your knowledge and spirit with others.       Mary Anthony, PWGSC Supply Officer                                                             <br>
<br>
 The Insights Seminar as well as the High Performance Leadership Seminar has allowed me to take a step back when dealing with colleagues.  What I mean by that is, rather than jumping to my own conclusions about people and the things they do, I have more of a tendency to think about their style now.  Basicallyto quote the course &quot;Understanding and Appreciating Differences in People&quot;<br>
<br>
The Seminars have given me a greater appreciation of where people are coming from and their perspective.  My focus has mainly been on communicating with staff.  Learning to be a better listener and provide more positive feedback and appreciation for the work that they do whether in their performance reviews or just in everyday conversations. <br>
<br>
The other area that I am working on (on me) is becoming better at delegating.  I find this very difficult (as if I am burdening others) but have realized more and more that if I delegate to the staff that have the abilities to do the work then it gets done and we meet target dates.      <br>
Donna Wozni, A/Manager, Quality Assurance/Western Region,  Public Works and Government Services Canada    <br>
<br>
The training provided was very informative.  It provided a good insight on people styles of communications and a view of how they function within the organization.  It was fun and light as well as enriching and a good window to each person&#39;s own performance and character.   Maria Dumitrescu, M. Eng., P.Eng., Area Project Manager - Alberta North &amp;NWT - Public Works and Government Services <br>
<br>
Its magic when you get it right. All in all, Insights was the best session of its kind that I have attended.  While things like Myers-Briggs are of some value, this program provided very practical application. Mark Harrison, Regional Director, PWGSCanada<br>
<br>
Comments from PWGSC front line teams: <br>
<br>
I personally want to thank you for a wonderful few days in Candle Lake. The seminar not only made an impact to my work relationships but also on my personal awareness and personal relationships. I believe these seminars are of great importance.  It was an absolute pleasure. At first I was skeptical but after going through the process Im very impressed and surprised with how real and valid the information is.  The most important aspect to me was getting an understanding of how I relate to others (as this has never been something Ive previously understood.)<br>
<br>
It provided a good insight on my co-workers &amp; work communication styles.<br>
I really enjoyed the course and I think it will help my group work better as a team.<br>
 Very enjoyable. Excellent presenter. Excellent tools for both work and personal life.<br>
 This was a thought provoking and enlightening process. I value the time spent.<br>
 Very good to learn how to understand others and why they process information differently.<br>
 A very good seminar which would benefit most people and enhance their ability to interact more effectively with other team members. The most valuable idea for me was the flexing, and how to approach people of different personalities.<br>
 This is the best team building/understanding behaviour session I have ever experienced!<br>
 I found the seminar very interesting. It helped me to understand myself better and will help me to work better with others.  Very interesting  good way to see how we can work together.<br>
 Interesting, but would be even more valuable with spouse taking course together.<br>
 Good information and a great way to communicate with the people you work with.<br>
 Usable information for all aspects of lifehome/family/kids and with work colleagues.<br>
 Excellent  will be valuable at home and work.  Good job Neil.  Glad I attended!<br>
 This seminar helped me significantly with understanding my direct reports.  Thanks Neil, much appreciated!<br>

SEMINAR:  INSIGHTS INTO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, ENGAGEMENT &amp; TEAMWORK <br>
<br>
This One-Day (or One-On-One Coaching) Diagnostics Based Program on INSIGHTS INTO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, ENGAGEMENT &amp; TEAMWORK will be customized to meet the specific needs of your team. <br>
<br>
A detailed, TWO part 53-54 page narrative description, along with the Insights wheel, is generated from the individual&#39;s responses to the Insights Analysis online diagnostics questionnaire.  The reports are extremely comprehensive and astonishingly revealing, providing positive input and action ideas for maximum performance and goal achievement.  <br>
<br>
•	Part one focuses on BEHAVIORS.   It provides the tools for understanding and appreciating differences in people. <br>
•	Part two focuses MOTIVATORS and VALUES, the WHY behind your behavior and actions.<br>
<br>
We use two personality profile systems to fast-track learning an effective communication language. These systems fit perfectly with Myers-Briggs and multiply the benefits of that or similar investments. You will learn to Understand and Appreciate Differences in People through a visual representation of eight behavioral styles and six motivators/values/attitudes that drive behavior. <br>
<br>
Imagine a time and place where everyone in your organization shares a common language. Imagine a language which allows them to communicate more effectively 24/7, with customers, colleagues and family. Imagine having a language which helps them to recognize and value the contributions that each individual can make. A language which makes personal development, empowerment and team centered leadership a way of life. Our journey will take you to a place where all of these things are possible. <br>
<br>
Managers and human resource professionals worldwide are using these amazing tools. The Insights program, through its unique link between the latest computer software and a model of relationships unparalleled in simplicity, offers great depth and goes further than ever before in meeting interpersonal challenges. <br>
<br>
The research behind Insights draws upon the most fundamental and tested concepts in the area of understanding how people function. <br>
<br>
The Success INSIGHTS WHEEL demonstrates the differences between persons Natural Style, Adapted Style and Work Environment. In addition, when profiling a team, the DISC practitioner can see the team’s behavioral composition and potential conflicts at a glance with the Wheel. <br>
<br>
The integration of the Success Insights Wheel into your business or department will build your credibility as well as increase your knowledge of observable human behavior. Here’s what a PWGSC Regional Director says: It’s magic when you get it right. All in all, Insights was the best session of its kind that I have attended. While things like Myers-Briggs are of some value, this program provided very practical application. Mark Harrison, Regional Director, Public Works Gov’t Services Canada <br>
<br>

PERFORM AT YOUR BEST - EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS <br>
<br>
Keys to Peak Performance, Personal Leadership &amp; Effective Engagement - Three Day Program. <br>
<br>
TESTIMONIAL:  &quot;This seminar has taken all the best training tools available and pulled them together in the most dynamic way I have ever experienced. It is exceptional and should be the foundation of every company’s vision.” Training Manager, Canada Post Corporation, Winnipeg <br>
<br>
THREE Earlier versions of this multimedia program by Brian Tracy were called: The Psychology of Achievement; The Phoenix Seminar and Maximum Achievement Seminar. This up-dated program provides almost all of the skills asked for in the Employability Skills Profile provided by the Conference Board of Canada. <br>
<br>
Why are some people more successful and more fulfilled than others? Why are only a minority of employees “fully engaged” in most organizations today? These questions have been studied by the greatest thinkers throughout the ages. This program is designed to give individuals the strategies, methods and practical  “How to” techniques practiced by the most successful, happy, and productive - engaged people in our society. <br>
<br>
•	TESTIMONIAL:  “It has been 3 1/2 years of self discovery and untold awakenings since I attended your Seminar. Over my 24-year government career, I attended a number of self-improvement courses. This course, by far, was worth more than the rest combined. There are times in one’s life when “thanks” just isn’t good enough, and this is one of them. The seminar changed my life and I thank you for that.” E K, PWGSC <br>
•	As many of our graduates have said…“This seminar was worth more than any year I spent at university. It&#39;s helping to make all my other learning work more effectively. It provided many of the missing &#39;soft - people skills&#39; I needed!” <br>
<br>
ESSENTIAL SKILLS <br>
<br>
All personal and professional skills learning fits into TWO basic categories and both are Essential Skills for career success <br>
<br>
1. Technical Skills:  These skills are very essential for career success, but are only 5-20% of the skills needed for lifelong employability. Those who have excellent technical skills but lack the People Factor Skills are often fired or wished away. <br>
<br>
2. Personal Management Skills for Effective Engagement:  Attitude: From 80-95% of career/life success depends on these “attitude skills” for engagement. These Personal Management Skills are also referred to as “soft skills”, “life skills”, “employability skills”…summarized in one word it’s all about “attitude”! While these skills are generally not provided in our educational institutions, they can be learned rapidly through the programs we provide! <br>
<br>
<br>
THE SOLUTION FOR CREATING AN ENGAGED WORKFORCE <br>
<br>
The Perform at Your Best - Employability Skills Seminar is a fast-track program designed to give you the strategies, methods and specific tools &amp; techniques practiced by the most balanced, successful, happy and productive service oriented people in our society. <br>
<br>
Most importantly the seminar adjusts participants’ attitude to assume responsibility for action, thought, and the future without excuses, politics and blame. <br>
<br>
The Perform at Your Best Seminar has been shared with more than one million people all over the world. Tens of thousands of people in some of the biggest and best corporations and government departments have been through this program and ranked it as &quot;the finest seminar on personal and professional development ever created&quot;. <br>
<br>

•	“This will have a profound impact on my personal and professional life.

I firmly believe that this seminar is absolutely mandatory for all people I work with!” KS, Regional Manager, Asset Management, RCMP <br>
•	“This was a powerful seminar, which I enjoyed tremendously. It has left me excited as I apply the many ideas and principles taught to both my personal and professional life.  “This course is truly one of the best I have attended and I enthusiastically recommend it to all Health Canada employees. This seminar would enhance their performance at work and increase their personal growth by empowering them to make positive choices and decisions in all aspects of their lives. The outcome for Health Canada would be the ultimate employee wellness program resulting in higher employee morale, a more solidified team spirit and an increase of productivity in each department.  The feedback from the other participants who attended this seminar has also been very positive and has reinforced my belief that all of Health Canada and its employees would benefit from this course.” DC, Director, Finance &amp; Admin., Health Canada <br>
<br>
ATTITUDE - By Charles Swindoll <br>
<br>
The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company a home. <br>
<br>
The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past, we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. <br>
<br>
I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I respond to it. <br>

            Our training programs effectively combine lectures, team activities, group discussions, and assessments to help people discover their own strengths and weaknesses.  Our workshops are highly enjoyable and participative.  <br>
<br>
For the Insights programs each participant receives a comprehensive personal computerized report on his or her personal team preferences, along with course notes, exercises and reference materials for follow-up purposes, plus a graduation certificate!<br>
<br>
In the other Multi-Media programs listed,  we provide workbooks and CDs for followup and review.<br>
<br>
Our multimedia seminars are video or PowerPoint assisted and therefore require a Projector, Laptop, Flip Charts etc.

              &quot;The Maximum Achievement Seminar has taken all the best training tools available and pulled them together in the most dynamic way I have ever experienced. It is exceptional and should be the foundation of every companys vision.   Pat Sylvester, Training Manager, Canada Post Corporation, Winnipeg<br>
<br>
Most important personal development training that I have undertaken in the past 20+ years.  The best and most valuable ideas that I will apply are to eliminate destructive criticism and negative statements; set personal goals daily and set meaningful deadlines; daily affirmations  daily challenge to make myself even more valuable and take responsibility, take action.  Neil was absolutely professional, excellent.  Tremendous!  Gut wrenching!                        Richard Sweet, Manager, Technical Services, CPC<br>
<br>
 The Maximum Achievement Seminar opened my eyes, and changed my life! I had become someone who was ungrateful for his job and nowIm applying to become a supervisor, a supervisor like the one who gave me the gift of Maximum Achievement.                          Craig Anaka, Canada Post Corporation<br>
<br>
My hope and dream is that eventually all Health Canada employees in our Region (including the Regional Executive Committee) attend the Seminar.  In the short term, I see enormous benefits in having at minimum those working in Human Resources attend.  It will be one of the greatest investments (both time and financially) we will ever make for our people.     Howard Berg, Manager,                                                                Learning, Careers, Diversity Services at Health Canada <br>
<br>
 This was by far the best seminar that I have attended in my twenty-one years with RCMP. With uncommon practicality the seminar leaves participants transformed, ready and committed to a dramatic change in attitude in their personal as well as professional life.   Tom Wieclawski, Manager, Learning Technology and Creative Services <br>
<br>
Everyone, managers, workers, spouses should go through this at least once, preferably early in their career or life. It really opened my eyes about myself. Thank You.                                              		  Ken Doege, Mechanical Maintenance Technician<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been three and a half years of self discovery and untold awakenings since I attended your Phoenix Seminar.  Over my 24-year government career, I attended a number of self-improvement courses.  This course, by far, was worth more than the rest combined.   There are times in one&#39;s life when &quot;thanks&quot; just isn&#39;t good enough, and this is one of them.  The seminar changed my life and I thank you for that.&quot;     	Ed Klemm, PWGSC<br>
<br>
 This will have a profound impact on my personal and professional life.  I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing me how to remove the clouds and allow me to see clearly the impacts that I have had and can haveat home and at work.  I firmly believe that this seminar is absolutely mandatory for all people I work with!   Kevin Serle, Regional Manager, Asset Management, RCMP<br>
<br>
Insights Testimonials by PWGSC Managers<br>
<br>
Since attending the Insights Seminar in September 2008, I have found myself going back several times to read over my profile, and the general characteristics of the other groups.  This has proven helpful both at work and amongst family and friends.  Overall, I have found the Insights Seminar material very useful as a &quot;self-examining&quot; resource.                     Dan McRuer, PWGSC Acting Supply Specialist<br>
<br>
 Thank you for the Insights Seminar experience. Not only is the information fun, it has proven to be useful, especially at work.   Thank you again for the work you do and for sharing your knowledge and spirit with others.       Mary Anthony, PWGSC Supply Officer                                                             <br>
<br>
 The Insights Seminar as well as the High Performance Leadership Seminar has allowed me to take a step back when dealing with colleagues.  What I mean by that is, rather than jumping to my own conclusions about people and the things they do, I have more of a tendency to think about their style now.  Basicallyto quote the course &quot;Understanding and Appreciating Differences in People&quot;<br>
<br>
The Seminars have given me a greater appreciation of where people are coming from and their perspective.  My focus has mainly been on communicating with staff.  Learning to be a better listener and provide more positive feedback and appreciation for the work that they do whether in their performance reviews or just in everyday conversations. <br>
<br>
The other area that I am working on (on me) is becoming better at delegating.  I find this very difficult (as if I am burdening others) but have realized more and more that if I delegate to the staff that have the abilities to do the work then it gets done and we meet target dates.      <br>
Donna Wozni, A/Manager, Quality Assurance/Western Region,  Public Works and Government Services Canada    <br>
<br>
The training provided was very informative.  It provided a good insight on people styles of communications and a view of how they function within the organization.  It was fun and light as well as enriching and a good window to each person&#39;s own performance and character.   Maria Dumitrescu, M. Eng., P.Eng., Area Project Manager - Alberta North &amp;NWT - Public Works and Government Services <br>
<br>
Its magic when you get it right. All in all, Insights was the best session of its kind that I have attended.  While things like Myers-Briggs are of some value, this program provided very practical application. Mark Harrison, Regional Director, PWGSCanada<br>
<br>
Comments from PWGSC front line teams: <br>
<br>
I personally want to thank you for a wonderful few days in Candle Lake. The seminar not only made an impact to my work relationships but also on my personal awareness and personal relationships. I believe these seminars are of great importance.  It was an absolute pleasure. At first I was skeptical but after going through the process Im very impressed and surprised with how real and valid the information is.  The most important aspect to me was getting an understanding of how I relate to others (as this has never been something Ive previously understood.)<br>
<br>
It provided a good insight on my co-workers &amp; work communication styles.<br>
I really enjoyed the course and I think it will help my group work better as a team.<br>
 Very enjoyable. Excellent presenter. Excellent tools for both work and personal life.<br>
 This was a thought provoking and enlightening process. I value the time spent.<br>
 Very good to learn how to understand others and why they process information differently.<br>
 A very good seminar which would benefit most people and enhance their ability to interact more effectively with other team members. The most valuable idea for me was the flexing, and how to approach people of different personalities.<br>
 This is the best team building/understanding behaviour session I have ever experienced!<br>
 I found the seminar very interesting. It helped me to understand myself better and will help me to work better with others.  Very interesting  good way to see how we can work together.<br>
 Interesting, but would be even more valuable with spouse taking course together.<br>
 Good information and a great way to communicate with the people you work with.<br>
 Usable information for all aspects of lifehome/family/kids and with work colleagues.<br>
 Excellent  will be valuable at home and work.  Good job Neil.  Glad I attended!<br>
 This seminar helped me significantly with understanding my direct reports.  Thanks Neil, much appreciated!<br>
