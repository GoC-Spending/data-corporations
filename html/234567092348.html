                            Telecommunications infrastructure is a vital asset for property owners. Management of this asset is necessary to retain existing tenants and attract new prospects. Building owners are often unaware of the state of their telecommunications assets, and may not have a clear understanding of which carriers are present in their building, what type of voice and data services they offer, or whether the building infrastructure is sufficient to support tenant technology requirements.<br>
The Attain Group Telecom Building Condition Report is a comprehensive telecommunications audit that ensures property owners have a clear understanding of their telecommunications assets, associated liabilities, and lifecycle planning requirements for telecom and other low-voltage systems.<br>

                            Telecommunications infrastructure is an integral part of the structure and lifecycle of a building. Yet, building owners and managers are often unaware of the state of their telecom infrastructure until a problem arises.<br>
<br>
With tenants selecting their communications service providers from a growing array of choices, a wide range of technicians may perform work in telecom rooms, through conduits and in ceiling and wall spaces. A proliferation of technologies, both wired and wireless, also adds to the complexity of telecom property management today.<br>
<br>
The Attain Group Telecom Maintenance &amp; Planning service provides building owners and managers with both long-term planning and short-term maintenance. We work to manage telecommunications assets consistent with the goals you have for your property.<br>

                            As an unregulated utility, telecommunications is often absent from the education and training available to property managers.

              Attain Services Reduce New Telecom Construction Costs by 25%<br>
Problem/Needs: <br>
<br>
A government department had recently purchased a 40,000 square foot building with an existing telecom infrastructure in place. The department wished to assess the existing infrastructure, identify which components were re-usable and of value, and determine whether any additional telecommunications equipment needed to be installed to meet the departments needs.<br>
<br>
Process: The Attain Group provided its Telecom Building Conditioning Report service to the client. This service included:<br>
<br>
Examination of inside and outside plant infrastructures to ensure that telecom rooms were sufficient and appropriately placed. <br>
Conduit assessments to ensure that sufficient pathways for low-voltage systems were present <br>
Rooftop audits to ensure that the existing wireless rooftop telecommunications infrastructure was sufficient <br>
<br>
Work Performed: In delivering the Telecom Building Conditioning Report service, The Attain Group audited and assessed the existing cable pathway infrastructure (both copper and fibre) to determine its inherent asset value and its reusability. Based on its assessment of the existing telecom infrastructure, The Attain Group was able to provide a report detailing further telecommunications equipment that would be required to meet the departments needs.<br>
<br>
Results: Based on The Attain Groups review, the department was able to reclaim a large portion of the buildings existing telecom infrastructure. By reusing the existing assets identified by The Attain Group, the department was able to save 25% of the total telecommunications construction budget cost.<br>

              Attain Consulting Services Lead to $25-Million Cable Plant Upgrade<br>
Problem/Needs: <br>
A division of the federal government required an audit of its aging telecommunications infrastructure. With more than 150 buildings and seven remote campuses across the province, the group lacked the internal resources to devote to such a project and wanted a third party to inspect and report on all components of its telecommunications infrastructure and provide a 15 year lifecycle budget.<br>
<br>
Process: The Attain Group provided its Lifecycle Management service to complete the project. This included:<br>
A comprehensive telecommunications equipment audit to document all existing telecom assets and to assess the state of those assets <br>
Verification of standards-compliant grounding and confirmation that the assets did not breach fire codes <br>
Delivery of a detailed 15-year lifecycle plan with associated tasks and budgets. <br>
An up-to-date equipment record of all low-voltage systems, along with a maintenance process<br>
<br>
Work Performed: In delivering the Lifecycle Management service, The Attain Group examined all telecom assets, determined their presen- day value, estimated replacement schedules and projected the existing equipments future costs. Attain also:<br>
<br>
Provided a report on immediate deficiencies and associated repair costs <br>
Identified current or potential health and safety violations and methods for their remedy <br>
Delivered a complete 15-year lifecycle management report for predictive costing and budgeting of the organizations telecommunications infrastructure<br>
<br>
Results: Based on the recommendations in The Attain Groups report, the client&#39;s cable plant manager was able to receive $25 million in funding within one week of submitting his budgetary request.<br>

                            Telecommunications infrastructure is a vital asset for property owners. Management of this asset is necessary to retain existing tenants and attract new prospects. Building owners are often unaware of the state of their telecommunications assets, and may not have a clear understanding of which carriers are present in their building, what type of voice and data services they offer, or whether the building infrastructure is sufficient to support tenant technology requirements.<br>
The Attain Group Telecom Building Condition Report is a comprehensive telecommunications audit that ensures property owners have a clear understanding of their telecommunications assets, associated liabilities, and lifecycle planning requirements for telecom and other low-voltage systems.<br>

                            Telecommunications infrastructure is an integral part of the structure and lifecycle of a building. Yet, building owners and managers are often unaware of the state of their telecom infrastructure until a problem arises.<br>
<br>
With tenants selecting their communications service providers from a growing array of choices, a wide range of technicians may perform work in telecom rooms, through conduits and in ceiling and wall spaces. A proliferation of technologies, both wired and wireless, also adds to the complexity of telecom property management today.<br>
<br>
The Attain Group Telecom Maintenance &amp; Planning service provides building owners and managers with both long-term planning and short-term maintenance. We work to manage telecommunications assets consistent with the goals you have for your property.<br>

* Mitigate risk and liability<br>
* Provide new sources of revenue<br>
* Develop operational efficiencies<br>
<br>
The program includes:<br>
* Telecom Condition Building Report<br>
* Recommendations<br>

              Attain Services Reduce New Telecom Construction Costs by 25%<br>
Problem/Needs: <br>
<br>
A government department had recently purchased a 40,000 square foot building with an existing telecom infrastructure in place. The department wished to assess the existing infrastructure, identify which components were re-usable and of value, and determine whether any additional telecommunications equipment needed to be installed to meet the departments needs.<br>
<br>
Process: The Attain Group provided its Telecom Building Conditioning Report service to the client. This service included:<br>
<br>
Examination of inside and outside plant infrastructures to ensure that telecom rooms were sufficient and appropriately placed. <br>
Conduit assessments to ensure that sufficient pathways for low-voltage systems were present <br>
Rooftop audits to ensure that the existing wireless rooftop telecommunications infrastructure was sufficient <br>
<br>
Work Performed: In delivering the Telecom Building Conditioning Report service, The Attain Group audited and assessed the existing cable pathway infrastructure (both copper and fibre) to determine its inherent asset value and its reusability. Based on its assessment of the existing telecom infrastructure, The Attain Group was able to provide a report detailing further telecommunications equipment that would be required to meet the departments needs.<br>
<br>
Results: Based on The Attain Groups review, the department was able to reclaim a large portion of the buildings existing telecom infrastructure. By reusing the existing assets identified by The Attain Group, the department was able to save 25% of the total telecommunications construction budget cost.<br>

              Attain Consulting Services Lead to $25-Million Cable Plant Upgrade<br>
Problem/Needs: <br>
A division of the federal government required an audit of its aging telecommunications infrastructure. With more than 150 buildings and seven remote campuses across the province, the group lacked the internal resources to devote to such a project and wanted a third party to inspect and report on all components of its telecommunications infrastructure and provide a 15 year lifecycle budget.<br>
<br>
Process: The Attain Group provided its Lifecycle Management service to complete the project. This included:<br>
A comprehensive telecommunications equipment audit to document all existing telecom assets and to assess the state of those assets <br>
Verification of standards-compliant grounding and confirmation that the assets did not breach fire codes <br>
Delivery of a detailed 15-year lifecycle plan with associated tasks and budgets. <br>
An up-to-date equipment record of all low-voltage systems, along with a maintenance process<br>
<br>
Work Performed: In delivering the Lifecycle Management service, The Attain Group examined all telecom assets, determined their presen- day value, estimated replacement schedules and projected the existing equipments future costs. Attain also:<br>
<br>
Provided a report on immediate deficiencies and associated repair costs <br>
Identified current or potential health and safety violations and methods for their remedy <br>
Delivered a complete 15-year lifecycle management report for predictive costing and budgeting of the organizations telecommunications infrastructure<br>
<br>
Results: Based on the recommendations in The Attain Groups report, the client&#39;s cable plant manager was able to receive $25 million in funding within one week of submitting his budgetary request.<br>
