        <br>            Planning is understanding where you are right now, learning where you want to be and your wants in life. I will work with you through the process to help you close any gaps in achieving your goals. The purpose of life planning is to clarify your vision of life and discover how to achieve that vision. Your insights will help you make informed decisions and feel in control. You create a satisfying vision of life in four areas: home, lifestyle, family and career.<br><br><br>

<br>
Financial planning consists of six distinct steps. Understanding what they entail and finding out if your planner understands how to use them to develop the best plan for you will help you determine if you are receiving the guidance you should expect. It is a six step process!<br>

Mary Robertson is a woman that optimizes class and professionalism. Her work with the Brighton and District Chamber of Commerce, as President, has shown her passion and enthusiasm for making a genuine difference in the community she lives. The most impressive part of Mary&#39;s work in regards to the Chamber is that she is not even from Brighton! Having been raised in Brighton, it is especially gratifying to see someone who care so much about the town. Furthermore, this is an indication of her commitment to doing the best job possible, regardless of what she is doing. In terms of her financial advisor role, Mary has personally provided me with information that will undoubtedly benefit my business. Her guidance and advice have been very helpful in planning for the future growth of my business and I look forward to expanding our working relationship. The bottom line is that Mary is an incredible woman who has earned my respect and gratitude in a very short period of time. It has been an honour getting to know and to work with Mary Robertson. November 30, 2008<br>

Mary Robertson is a woman that optimizes class and professionalism. Her work with the Brighton and District Chamber of Commerce, as President, has shown her passion and enthusiasm for making a genuine difference in the community she lives. The most impressive part of Mary&#39;s work in regards to the Chamber is that she is not even from Brighton! Having been raised in Brighton, it is especially gratifying to see someone who care so much about the town. Furthermore, this is an indication of her commitment to doing the best job possible, regardless of what she is doing. In terms of her financial advisor role, Mary has personally provided me with information that will undoubtedly benefit my business. Her guidance and advice have been very helpful in planning for the future growth of my business and I look forward to expanding our working relationship. The bottom line is that Mary is an incredible woman who has earned my respect and gratitude in a very short period of time. It has been an honour getting to know and to work with Mary Robertson. November 30, 2008<br>
