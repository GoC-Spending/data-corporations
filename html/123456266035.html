RSL-2702 Roll Laminator<br>
Fast - Laminates thermal and pressure sensitive films up to 27&quot; (685 mm) wide at speeds up to 8.2&quot; (2.5m/min) per minute. <br>
Versatile - Able to mount rigid boards up to 3/16&quot; (6mm) and laminate up to 10mil (250mic) film, including THINFLEX. <br>
Flexible - Designed for laminating, encapsulating and mounting with adjustable nip settings (max. opening 3/16&quot;/6mm). <br>
Easy To Use - Soft touch digital keypad allows easy operation and function control of temperature, speed and stored programs. <br>
Convenient - Swing-out arm film shafts and drop down idler all in a tabletop roll laminator designed for a small working area. <br>
<br>
25&quot; Industrial Laminator<br>
Dependable...Productive...Trouble free...Easy to use...Versatile...Easy to maintain.These are the kinds of terms owners of the HD-25 use to describe their laminator. Intelligent Heat Controllers - display both the set temperature and the actual temperature.  the microprocessor in the control quickly learns to anticipate the heat demand of each job and keeps the actual temperature within a few degrees of the set temperature.<br>
Laminating and Pull Rollers - are covered with quality silicone rubber for superior release quality, higher lamination quality and easier cleaning.  The laminating rollers and pull rollers are interchangeable. <br>
Removable Heat Shoes - are teflon coated to reduce film abrasion.  They are easily unplugged and removed to clean or replace the laminating rollers. <br>
Built-in Retractable Slitters - save an enormous amount of cutting time by trimming away side scrap during the lamination process.   The two heads can be adjusted independently with great precision. <br>
Dual Tension Knobs - (clutches) for each supply roll mandrel are easy to use and provide as little or as much tension as needed to keep work wrinkle-free. <br>
Forced Air Cooling - is essential when running thicker films, because the lamination needs to be cooled to get good results. <br>
Easy Access Controls - are conveniently located and grouped for effective operation. <br>
A Safety Guard - is built into the feed tray to help insure it will always be in place when laminating. <br>
Both upper and Lower Rollers Are Driven - to minimize the wrinkling or curling that can occur when only one roller is driven <br>
Standard Precision Feed Tray - has both left and right side guides and can be replaced with the power feed tray in seconds. <br>
<br>
27&quot; Professor Laminator<br>
The 27&quot; Professor has been engineered to provide years of service with minimal maintenance. It laminates with up to 10 mil film and mounts materials up to 3/16&quot; thick. Its unique self-threading feature reduces the anxiety often associated with threading a laminator. The hot roll design permits simultaneous mounting and laminating using heat activated mounting boards.<br>
<br>
Mighty Lam 2700 27&quot; Laminator<br>
The MightyLam 2700 is capable of  laminating  from 1.5 mil  to 10 mil laminating film. Simplified, easy-to-set heat controls, and a variable speed control for operating at any speed up to 10 feet per minute. <br>
<br>
25&quot; Premier IV Laminator<br>
Variable Speed - operates at any speed up to 10 feet per minute.  Thicker films are generally applied better at mid-range to lower speeds, while 1.5 mil film should be applied at mid-range to higher speeds. <br>
Digital LCD Temperature Display - makes it easy to set and maintain the correct temperature.  The indicator light inside the heat switch comes on as the machine warms up; at set temperature the indicator light turns off. <br>
Simple Controls- Conveniently placed switches provide a compact, reliable control pad, icons and international symbols are used for controls and safety warnings. <br>
Slitters - Experts know the value of slitters for laminating a quantity of same-size sheets.  The slitters remove the side scrap from both sides of each sheet as it goes through the laminator...  this greatly reduces the amount of time required for trimming. <br>
Glitch-proof Threading - Threading can be the most difficult aspect of using a laminator, so the Premier 4 has built in threading aids.   The top idler is guarded from the top heat shoe for safety and easy threading.   The bottom idler is attached to the feed tray.  Once the upper and lower webs of film have been run through the machine, bottom idler threading is automatic when the operator puts the feed tray on the machine. <br>
<br>
25&quot; Educator Laminator<br>
Preset lamination pressure and speed - makes the machine easier to use and eliminates many possible sources of problems. <br>
Enclosed laminating and pull rollers - help you avoid time-consuming jams and wrap arounds. <br>
Forced air cooling - allows laminating with 1.5  and 3 mil films,   Without a film cooling system, thicker films will warp and ripple because they are still hot and partly melted when they come out the back of the laminator. <br>
Fixed-position lamination rollers - provide a stable platform for uniform roll pressure to provide the highest quality lamination available in a school laminator. <br>
Attached safety shield - the safety shield is fixed to the machine and is placed so that the operator will naturally put it in the guard position before laminating.  The shield is made of clear polycarbonate so users can see their work and will not be tempted to try to laminate without the shield in its safe position. <br>
Reverse switch - can be essential at times to help avoid problems or clear misfeeds. <br>
<br>
Easylam 27&quot; Laminator <br>
The easy-to-use design makes the operator&#39;s job simpler with features such as:<br>
Easy Loading - Plenty of clearance is allowed for film loading. No more burnt knuckles when &quot;hot loading&quot;.<br>
Easy-To-Use Controls - Since pressure, speed, and roll tension are preset, the laminator requires very little instruction to use.<br>
Adjustable Heat Knob - Heat is easily adjustable for different materials.<br>
Reverse Switch - Quickly clears any wrap-arounds.<br>

RSL-2702 Roll Laminator<br>
Fast - Laminates thermal and pressure sensitive films up to 27&quot; (685 mm) wide at speeds up to 8.2&quot; (2.5m/min) per minute. <br>
Versatile - Able to mount rigid boards up to 3/16&quot; (6mm) and laminate up to 10mil (250mic) film, including THINFLEX. <br>
Flexible - Designed for laminating, encapsulating and mounting with adjustable nip settings (max. opening 3/16&quot;/6mm). <br>
Easy To Use - Soft touch digital keypad allows easy operation and function control of temperature, speed and stored programs. <br>
Convenient - Swing-out arm film shafts and drop down idler all in a tabletop roll laminator designed for a small working area. <br>
<br>
25&quot; Industrial Laminator<br>
Dependable...Productive...Trouble free...Easy to use...Versatile...Easy to maintain.These are the kinds of terms owners of the HD-25 use to describe their laminator. Intelligent Heat Controllers - display both the set temperature and the actual temperature.  the microprocessor in the control quickly learns to anticipate the heat demand of each job and keeps the actual temperature within a few degrees of the set temperature.<br>
Laminating and Pull Rollers - are covered with quality silicone rubber for superior release quality, higher lamination quality and easier cleaning.  The laminating rollers and pull rollers are interchangeable. <br>
Removable Heat Shoes - are teflon coated to reduce film abrasion.  They are easily unplugged and removed to clean or replace the laminating rollers. <br>
Built-in Retractable Slitters - save an enormous amount of cutting time by trimming away side scrap during the lamination process.   The two heads can be adjusted independently with great precision. <br>
Dual Tension Knobs - (clutches) for each supply roll mandrel are easy to use and provide as little or as much tension as needed to keep work wrinkle-free. <br>
Forced Air Cooling - is essential when running thicker films, because the lamination needs to be cooled to get good results. <br>
Easy Access Controls - are conveniently located and grouped for effective operation. <br>
A Safety Guard - is built into the feed tray to help insure it will always be in place when laminating. <br>
Both upper and Lower Rollers Are Driven - to minimize the wrinkling or curling that can occur when only one roller is driven <br>
Standard Precision Feed Tray - has both left and right side guides and can be replaced with the power feed tray in seconds. <br>
<br>
27&quot; Professor Laminator<br>
The 27&quot; Professor has been engineered to provide years of service with minimal maintenance. It laminates with up to 10 mil film and mounts materials up to 3/16&quot; thick. Its unique self-threading feature reduces the anxiety often associated with threading a laminator. The hot roll design permits simultaneous mounting and laminating using heat activated mounting boards.<br>
<br>
Mighty Lam 2700 27&quot; Laminator<br>
The MightyLam 2700 is capable of  laminating  from 1.5 mil  to 10 mil laminating film. Simplified, easy-to-set heat controls, and a variable speed control for operating at any speed up to 10 feet per minute. <br>

25&quot; Premier IV Laminator<br>
Variable Speed - operates at any speed up to 10 feet per minute.  Thicker films are generally applied better at mid-range to lower speeds, while 1.5 mil film should be applied at mid-range to higher speeds. <br>
Digital LCD Temperature Display - makes it easy to set and maintain the correct temperature.  The indicator light inside the heat switch comes on as the machine warms up; at set temperature the indicator light turns off. <br>
Simple Controls- Conveniently placed switches provide a compact, reliable control pad, icons and international symbols are used for controls and safety warnings. <br>
Slitters - Experts know the value of slitters for laminating a quantity of same-size sheets.  The slitters remove the side scrap from both sides of each sheet as it goes through the laminator...  this greatly reduces the amount of time required for trimming. <br>
Glitch-proof Threading - Threading can be the most difficult aspect of using a laminator, so the Premier 4 has built in threading aids.   The top idler is guarded from the top heat shoe for safety and easy threading.   The bottom idler is attached to the feed tray.  Once the upper and lower webs of film have been run through the machine, bottom idler threading is automatic when the operator puts the feed tray on the machine. <br>
<br>
25&quot; Educator Laminator<br>
Preset lamination pressure and speed - makes the machine easier to use and eliminates many possible sources of problems. <br>
Enclosed laminating and pull rollers - help you avoid time-consuming jams and wrap arounds. <br>
Forced air cooling - allows laminating with 1.5  and 3 mil films,   Without a film cooling system, thicker films will warp and ripple because they are still hot and partly melted when they come out the back of the laminator. <br>
Fixed-position lamination rollers - provide a stable platform for uniform roll pressure to provide the highest quality lamination available in a school laminator. <br>
Attached safety shield - the safety shield is fixed to the machine and is placed so that the operator will naturally put it in the guard position before laminating.  The shield is made of clear polycarbonate so users can see their work and will not be tempted to try to laminate without the shield in its safe position. <br>
Reverse switch - can be essential at times to help avoid problems or clear misfeeds. <br>
<br>
Easylam 27&quot; Laminator <br>

Easy-To-Use Controls - Since pressure, speed, and roll tension are preset, the laminator requires very little instruction to use.<br>
Adjustable Heat Knob - Heat is easily adjustable for different materials.<br>
